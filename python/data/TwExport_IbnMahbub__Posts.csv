"2009365468050596010","Imām al-Saffārīnī’s endorsement of Kitāb al-Tawḥīd by Sh Muḥammad Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb

Sh Sulaymān Ibn ʿAbdullāh, the grandson of Sh Muḥammad Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, explains that many scholars were sent copies of Kitāb al-Tawḥīd for review, with these scholars endorsing and approving of its content.

Sh Sulaymān then explains that these scholars were unable to support the najdī daʾwah in practice due to their lack of power and authority.

• Sh Sulaymān Ibn ʿAbdullāh Āl al-Shaykh said:

❝As for the distinction mentioned, it is not the reason for sending it, for it was not sent in order to be drafted and then approved; rather, it had already been drafted and approved by eminent Shaykhs and great authorities among them: the Syrian shaykhs, Shaykh ʿAlī Efendi al-Dāghistānī—whose name we have already mentioned—and his cousin Shaykh ʿAbd al-Karīm Efendi al-Dāghistānī, Shaykh Muḥammad al-Burhānī, Shaykh ʿUthmān al-Diyār Bakrī, a resident of Madīnah al-Munawwarah, and Shaykh Muḥammad al-Saffārīnī, a resident of Nābulus. A copy was sent to him, and he approved and endorsed it apart from the Shaykhs who have already been mentioned; for among them were those who fully grasped its wording, and all of them approved it, refined it, and granted authorization (ijāzah) for it.

Their excuse, however, is the lack of assistance enabling them to carry out what it contains regarding establishing the religion and purifying it for the Lord of the Worlds. Otherwise, this is what they themselves hold as their religion before Allāh in regard to themselves, their families, and their companions from among their clans. Yet they are unable to forbid people from what they have believed, practiced, and spoken, because that requires an established sword and a just Imām, and that is presently unattainable except by the grace and bringing-about of Allāh.❞

"2009116443950850227","The Palestinian Mujāhid Nizār Rayyān, in his final will, advised the Muslims to adhere the ʿaqīdah outlined in Ibn Abī al-ʿIzz al-Ḥanafī’s explanation of al-ʿAqīdat al-Ṭaḥāwīyyah, a famous  ʿaqīdah exclusive to the Wahhābīs.

@Haqiqatjou During your conversation with Shadee, make sure to ask him what he thinks about this creed and whether he considers it Sunnī or not.

• The Mujāhid Nizār Rayyān said:

“I also enjoin them with the creed of Imām al-Ṭaḥāwī for good, for with the commentary of Ibn Abī al-ʿIzz al-Ḥanafī it is the sound creed, Allāh willing. And I enjoin them to keep away from the squabbles of the misguided, whoever they may be…”

“I enjoin my family, my relatives, my noble wives, my sons and my daughters to fear Allāh, to act upon all that our great religion commands, to seek Islāmic knowledge from the Book and the Sunnah, to adhere to the Salafī creed such as al-Ṭaḥāwiyyah with the commentary of Ibn Abī al-ʿIzz al-Ḥanafī, to remain with the jihādī Islamists so long as they remain upon the religion and uphold it, and to overlook what Allāh has overlooked for people…”","ro","Retweet","Ibrāhīm Ibn Maḥmūd","ibmsulaymani","32865","6","25","1","132","69","2026-01-08 06:14:22","https://x.com/ibmsulaymani/status/2009116443950850227","<a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/download/ipad"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPad</a>","","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-HQwTkWIAA2glo.jpg
