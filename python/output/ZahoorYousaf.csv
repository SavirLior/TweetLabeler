""Shaykh @AbuKhadeejahSP  Defense of Shaykh @AbuIyaadSP:



Question: How do we deal with those who spread lies about our brothers from the Tullab-ul-Ilm and from the Mashaikh in this country and elsewhere who the Kibar-ul-Ulama have recommended for decades?

Shaykh Abu Khadeejah Abul Wahid (May Allah preserve him) answers:

""And I say to you that we pay no attention if it is a lie. And a lot of it is lies and rumours and falsehoods and Namima that we pay no attention to it.

We've got more important things to do. Look at this conference. Is this more important? Or listening to lies that are spread about our brothers and our elders in the Dawah for 30, 35 years giving nothing morning, evening and night, giving Khidmah to the Dawah.

Why are we going to turn and pay attention to that? when you look at their translations, you look at their works, you look at their websites, you look at their audios and the books that they teach and I can name, you know, Shaykh Abu Iyad, Shaykh Uwais At-Tawil, Shaykh Abu Idrees, you know, all of these brothers and other than them from our brothers in Britain, in North America and elsewhere.

So, in this day and age that we live, then this is something that is Aadi. It's something that is normal and it is not the first time, you know, that this has happened in history.

People have been wrongly accused and lied upon. So, what do we do? We pay no attention to it. 
Baarakallahu Feekum. 

We know the truth. We know our brothers. I know Shaykh Abu Iyad. I know Shaykh Abdul Ilah. I know Shaykh Abu Idrees. I know Shaykh Uwais. And I know my brothers from the rest of the teachers in this country. I know them. I know those who are teaching up and down the country, whether it's Ustadh Abdul Hakim Mitchell or whether it's Ustadh Abu Humaid or Abu Ukaasha or Zubair ah Somali or Hilal or other than them. We know our brothers, and we know them for Khair.

It doesn't mean that we are not, and especially myself, that I'm not, you know, free of mistakes. We can all make a mistake, but they are our brothers. Ah-Deenuh Naseeha. If you see a mistake from your brother, give him advice.

Don't destroy his honor. Destroy his rank. Make him despicable in the eyes of the people. This is not our way. This is not the way of the Ulama. This is not the way of the Salaf.

If you look at what I've just mentioned over the two lectures that I've given. Is this the way of Rasulullah salallahu alayhi wa sallam? That he would treat people like this. A person, people who are known for Sidq and Amanah and truthfulness and defending the deen so much so that they take attacks from Ahlul Bid'ah morning, noon and night.

You know, I went to a masjid in Pakistan. And afterwards, after we finished from the masjid, normally the brothers, we stand outside for a few minutes, give Salam before we go home. So, someone came and they said, oh, the masjid said that they know you. I said, Oh, okay. I said, and what do they think? He said, well, they googled you. And I said, what did they find? They said they found, article after article after article, insulting you, abusing you. That are some good. And they're not comfortable with you. Alhamdulillah.

Right? So, they attack and they insult because that's social media, right? Anyone can go on there, make an account and insult another person. But Yawm al-Qiyamah, we're going to see. Deeds of the people are going to be displayed Yawm al-Qiyamah.

And I forgive every Salafi who ever attacked me. But I will not forgive a person of Bid'ah up until he repents to Allah. That's between him and Allah because he opposed the deen. As for him insulting me personally, I forgive them.

So, morning, noon and night, our brothers. Since the early 90s, subhanallah. I was introduced to Salafiyyah, I'd say in 1988 or 89. It's not that I embraced it immediately and started practicing. No, but I was introduced to it, and I accepted the principles very early on when my brother gave me da'wah in 88 or 89.

And through those years, we've seen the da'wah grow and grow from the earliest of the people that I met was Abu Talha, Rahimahullah, Sheikh Abu Talha and my first teacher, of course, Abu Iyad from those times. These were from the earliest of the people.

Even Sheikh Abdullilah, the earliest of the people that we met and there were many many others, and I could go through a whole list, but time won't allow. From that day to this day, I see khair from these people. So yes, it is not permissible to dishonor them or to call them liars.

You know, we know what Sheikh Rabi' bin Hadi Al-Madkhali thought of us. We know what Sheikh Ubaid bin Abdillah Al-Jabri thought of us. We know what Sheikh Muqabil bin Hadi Al-Wadi'i thought of us.

We know what Sheikh Abdullah al-Ghudayyan thought of us. We know what these Ulama Ahmad Al-Najmi and Zaid Al-Madkhali thought of us. We know these Ulama Al-Kibar from the major great scholars, Sheikh Hassan bin Abdul Wahab Al-Banna, Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab Al-Banna.

What these Ulama thought of the da'wah and the da'wah of Maktab As-Salafiyyah.

If we make a mistake, correct us. Bil Adab, with ikhlaas and sidhq. Because lying does not benefit anyone. Untruths don't benefit anything. It doesn't benefit the Haqq. Supposition and suspicion don't benefit the truth in any way whatsoever.

So, defend your brothers, defend your Mashaikh, defend our Ulama. Baarakallahu Feekum. 

Stick to the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith, ask for dalil and proofs. 

If someone comes and they make an accusation, bring your dalil. And we want the wording exactly. Word for word, what was said. Then show us from the Kitab and the Sunnah and the Salaf, where it opposes the Kitab and the Sunnah and the Salaf.

And we're on board. This is our Deen. Show us the Usul of Salafiyyah that have been contradicted.

Up until then, busy yourself with Ilm, attend the Duros, study the books, go to the Duroos of Sheikh Abdul Ilah and Sheikh Abu Iyad. That teaches Madarij Salikeen here in this Masjid once a month, doesn't it? The Masjid is packed right to the back. Why? Because people know Khair when they see Khair.

Because you're talking to Salafis. The Salafis recognize the good in him and the good in Sheikh Abu Idrees and the good in Sheikh Uwais and others. And now you see our brothers, they do conferences up and down the country.

Whether it be Abu Ukkasha or whether it be Abu Ukkasha Abdul Hakim, whether it be Zubair As-Somali or whether it be Yahya or whether it be, you know, Abu Humaid or Abdul Hakim Mitchell. And you see the people flocking to them seeking knowledge. They were in Ireland the other day, right? Abu Inaya as well. Hafidahumullah ta'la.

The people are flocking because people want Ilm. They don't want tittle-tattle and gossip and Qeel-waqal. So, attend those Duros, attend those gatherings of knowledge.

May Allah subahanu watala keep us steadfast upon Salafiyah.”

""Zina brings about poverty - that is, persistent and lasting poverty. For wealth is from the bounty of Allah, and bounty is for those who rejoice in Allah and in His giving. 

Allah has enriched His servants through what He made lawful for them of marriage, from His bounty. So whoever prefers fornication over it has preferred a joy that comes from Satan the accursed over the bounty of his Merciful Lord. 

When bounty departs, wealth departs and hardship comes. Thus fornication is charged with the removal of blessing. If a servant is afflicted by it and does not desist and return [in repentance], then let him bid farewell to the blessings of Allah, for they are a guest quick to depart and swift to vanish.
