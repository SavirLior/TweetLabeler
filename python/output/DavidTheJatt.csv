""It's impossible to 'restore pre-Islamic Sassanid Iranian culture,' because nobody remembers it. If it were possible, that would mean extolling mother-son and brother-sister marriages as a great religious deed, isolating menstruating women and girls under penalty of death (if they broke the isolation), and burying people alive for blasphemy. This is Zionist-level LARPing you're hearing from parts of the Iranian diaspora.

Somalia has killed Pakistanis on multiple occasions. 

The most tragic was on June 5 1993 when 24 Pakistani UN peacekeepers were ambushed and murdered in Mogadishu by forces loyal to warlord Farrah Aidid. 
( may Allah SWT have mercy on them )

That attack set off a chain of events leading to the US and UN offensive known as Operation Gothic Serpent

and ultimately the Black Hawk Down battle later that year.

In contrast, when Pakistanis come to Somaliland they are welcomed, respected, and given opportunities in high level jobs. They are valued as skilled, business minded, and tech savvy contributors to society.🇵🇰✌️
