"2011286644247155050","Ah, the cyber Basiji and agent of Khamenei should tell us why anyone should believe Khamenei’s taqiyyah fatwa, when he himself, at times, forgets to uphold it and instead reverts to the very foundation of his religion: takfir of the Sahabah. He even invites Shia eulogy singers to his Hosseiniyeh-temple who are known to curse the Sahabah.

And if any mental gymnastics are produced to excuse this, then a simple question remains for that cyber Basiji: when did Khamenei ever condemn Khomeini or ban his books, in which Khomeini--Khamenei’s own teacher and the founding father of the modern-day Shii Iranian state--explicitly stated that Aishah, the wife of the Prophet ﷺ, was more impure than dogs and pigs? This shirk defender, Haqiqatjou, under the pretext of unity, is sanitising Rafidism, which is exactly what the Rafidi regime of Iran has been doing; he is simply following their playbook.","en","Retweet","𝔈𝔟𝔫 ℌ𝔲𝔰𝔰𝔢𝔦𝔫 | حسن شمرانـــي","EbnHussein1424","10360","8","34","1","134","45","2026-01-14 05:57:58","https://x.com/EbnHussein1424/status/2011286644247155050","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>","","","video","https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/2011285787413778433/pu/vid/avc1/1080x1920/nC4wcVaOFtNqM1q1.mp4?tag=19"

This led to the establishment of Zionism in Palestine &amp; eventual destruction of the Ottoman state. Yet some Christians would tell you Jews ""loved"" being subjugated by Muslims. Is that they enabled Western Colonisation against us? Makes you wonder.

"2007214435849646580","The other ""Muslims"" mentioned (Ottomans) allied with Europeans to fight Wahhabis. They rejoiced when the Ottomans were victorious in the war, which led to Qawasim defeat. Know this war is what made the Saudis seek deals with the British in the first place.

@Malabari_1 is now denying Wahhabi Qawasim. Says a recent book can't cite primary sources then switches to whining that they're ""Wahhabi"". As if they'll be documented by Quburiyun instead? But we have the British corroborating these sources.

This jahil also quotes Hempher to ""prove"" this British ""alliance"" with the 1st/2nd Saudi state. This is *despite* knowing it's a forgery. He just wants to validate his seething hatred for the Najdi dawah. When will he instead admit Ottoman apostasy?
