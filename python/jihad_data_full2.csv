""The Ottoman empire’s rejection of Imām ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz’s peace offers

Despite the rejection displayed by ʿIrāq and its Ottoman governor, the First Saudi State did not confront ʿIrāq, did not attack it or approach its borders, nor did it skirmish with its tribes and clans or harass its caravans and pilgrim convoys.

This is a historical fact attested to by Burckhardt, who said: “The Wahhābīs did not declare war on the two governments nearest to them—the government of Baghdād in the north and the government of the Ḥijāz in the south—nor did they violate their rights. Pilgrim caravans from Damascus and Baghdād passed through their territories without suffering any harm.” The same was attested by the English historian Andrew Crichton and the Egyptian historian Maḥmūd Fahmī al-Muhandis, despite al-Muhandis’s opposition to the daʾwah and the First Saudi State.

What was established with certainty is that the Ottoman governor in ʿIrāq, together with the tribes and clans subordinate to him in its southern regions, were the ones who provoked and harassed the Saudis and initiated hostility against them. Thus, the well-known confrontations between the First Saudi State and the Ottoman crescent in ʿIrāq were merely a reaction on the part of the Saudis to the provocations of the Ottoman crescent in ʿIrāq and its aggressions against the people of the Saudi state, carried out with the support of the Ottoman government in Istanbul."""

""Truth Demands Firmness. When Met With Leniency, the Ummah Fades into Ruin.

During the Khilāfah of ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه), a man called Subaigh Ibn ‘Asal came to Madinah and asked persistently about the Mutashābihāt. 

ʿUmar (رضي الله عنه) summoned him and struck him until his head bled. Subaigh then said, “Enough, O Commander of the Faithful! What I used to find in my head has now gone.”

‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) then exiled him to Basra and wrote to its people, “Do not sit with him.”

Years later, when the Khawārij emerged, they invited Subaigh to join them and become a leader. Look at his response:

“Far be it! Allah has benefited me through the admonition of the righteous man, the Commander of the Faithful, ʿUmar (رضي الله عنه).”

Subaigh remained humbled until his death, after once been noble. 

We need men like ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه). Through firm discipline, exile, and social restriction, ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) cut off a potential source of deviation, encouraged Subaigh’s repentance, and set an example for all who stubbornly questioned that which brought no benefit.

""When Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) tested Shaykh Musa (حفظه الله تعالى) with trials weeks ago, his joyous and upbeat demeanor did not falter for a second, rather it increased. And when advised to step back from speaking with others, he firmly refused, asking ALL who reach out to speak with him be sent his way, Allahumma barek Lahu.

His own trials only strengthened his resolve to help others. Anytime Allah resolved a conflict through him, he rejoiced, celebrating and weeping in joy.

When we spoke to the Shaykh during this health crisis, may Allah protect him, he did not complain once. Though his voice bore the weight of fatigue, he spoke with unwavering strength, constantly praising Allah.

Trials reveal true character, so what do we say of someone whose character only grew more radiant through them? May Allah protect him, preserve him, grant him full Shifaa' and a long life filled with good deeds.

As always, please reach out to the Shaykh’s Instagram ( for any assistance or questions, or call, InshaAllah."""
