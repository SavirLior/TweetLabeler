Jumu'ah Khutbah 26/12/2025

The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: A Mercy That Purifies.

By Shaykh 'Abdulilah Lahmami @Abdulilah_UK (may Allāh protect him).

• The prophet (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) came to purify us, what does that mean? 
• Our prophet (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon) came to take us away from every lowly and evil manners and characteristics, and guided us to every noble and lofty manners and characteristics.
• Use your free time to visit family and relatives. Maintain the ties of kinship. 
• Don't search for the faults of others.
• Striving to have that secret good deed that no one knows about.
• The righteous used to fear showing-off, but nowadays so many people displaying their acts of worship on social media!
• The emotional and powerful words our mother 'A'aishah (may Allāh be pleased with her) said on her deathbed. 
• Always have righteous and sincere intentions and you will be rewarded much.","ca","Retweet","Markaz Mu’aadh","MarkazMuaadh","4664","0","14","0","29","3","2025-12-29 11:18:01","https://x.com/MarkazMuaadh/status/2005568980631634417","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>","","https://soundcloud.com/markazmuaadh/jumuah-khutbah-26122025-the-prophet-peace-and-blessings-of-allah-be-upon-him-a-mercy-that-purifies","",""
