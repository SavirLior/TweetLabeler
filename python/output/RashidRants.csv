""Today, I was arrested for the fourth time in less than three months. During interrogation, officers explicitly stated, 'jews keep calling' to report me.

The Metropolitan Police have traveled from London, booked hotel stays, and arrested me on four separate dates: October 21, December 4, December 22, and today, January 15—for social media posts sharing news, opposing 'israel' and expressing solidarity with Palestine.

I have been released on bail, which now combines the restrictive conditions from all three prior arrests. I remain under a form of house arrest and prohibited from attending Palestine events in London. I am also not to post anything that could 'stir up racial hatred' or 'express support for a proscribed organisation'—neither of which I have done.

This is state-sponsored harassment and judicial terrorism, carried out by the British state in partnership with the UK 'israel' lobby and also at the apparent behest of the jews who 'keep calling' the police, including the Anti-Terrorism Hotline, to silence me.

The Met officers today were Saul Carroll and Steve Burgess.

""Why Does the UAE Fight Islam in the West?

Because the United Arab Emirates does not view Islam as a moral message or a civilizational identity, but as a political threat especially any independent, grassroots model beyond the control of money and security alliances.
In the West, the UAE actively works to demonize Islam by funding think tanks, lobbying networks, and media narratives that deliberately blur the line between Islam and extremism, with the aim of:
•Appeasing Western allies by presenting itself as a bulwark against political Islam.
•Silencing independent Muslim voices that expose authoritarianism or defend just causes like Palestine.
•Whitewashing its authoritarian model as moderate Islam stripped of justice and values, designed for branding rather than accountability.

The result?
Restrictions on Muslims in the West, the distortion of their identity, and the reduction of an entire religion to a security file.
This is not a war on extremism it is a war on Islam when it is free, critical, and not for sale.

Islam is not the West’s problem. The problem is those who fear Muslim awareness and values when they don’t serve power and interests."""

""In 2020, Glasgow-based lawyer Matthew Berlow admitted to his role in a staged ""antisemitic"" graffiti attack at his own home intended to frame the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

Berlow collaborated with Ed Sutherland, then-head of religious and moral education at an academy in Ayr and a fellow pro-Israel activist, to create a false narrative on social media. Sutherland used a fake ""pro-Palestinian"" Facebook persona, ""Stevie Harrison,"" to post that Berlow’s home had been spray-painted with ""Free Palestine"".

Knowing the report was false, Berlow commented on the post, calling it ""Typical SPSC behaviour. Criminal,"" to publicly blame the solidarity group for the nonexistent crime.

The Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal and the Law Society of Scotland investigated the incident. In rulings as recently as September 2024 and January 2026, Berlow was found guilty of professional misconduct. The tribunal noted his actions ""lacked integrity"" and were ""likely to bring the profession into disrepute""."""

""MY EXPERIENCE OF (MALE) EMIRATI INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THE UK

Over the course of 12 years, I’ve met and spoken to many Emirati students studying in the UK, easily in the dozens. 

These encounters took place in my hometown of Bedford, where some had studied at the local college or university, as well as during my university years (2006–2009) at UEA Norwich, and while delivering lectures for student Islamic Societies (ISocs) across at least 30 universities (2015-2025). I also briefly befriended a few I met at gyms. 

So, here it goes:

- Most studied aeronautical engineering or other engineering disciplines.

- Several told me they had been instructed by their government not to discuss Islam or politics, or to engage in religious activities on campus.

- Eid gatherings, iftar events, and informal meet-ups with non-Emirati Muslims were strongly discouraged. Jumuah and Eid prayers were the only exception.

- Keeping long beards with trimmed moustaches, and regularly praying the five daily obligatory prayers in mosques, were also discouraged.

- Many were deeply paranoid and believed they were being monitored. They were particularly distrustful of Saudi and Egyptian international students. 

- Most appeared to deliberately isolate themselves from other Muslims, both on campus and within the communities they lived in.

- Quite a few were into partying, drinking alcohol and drug use. I know at least three Emirati students who privately identified as atheists.

- Others appeared to be studying abroad primarily to avoid or delay mandatory national military service back home.

- All were given very generous university allowances, between £4,000 and £7,000 per month, from the Emirati government, and understandably did not want to do anything that might risk losing that support.

- None I met were arrogant, disrespectful or rude. All except three proudly identified as Muslim. However, none were remotely involved in any (non-political) communal Muslim events or activities. This stood in stark contrast to Saudi, Egyptian, Qatari, Malaysian and Pakistani international students, who at the very least attended Eid and iftar gatherings organised by the Islamic society or their local mosque.

To be clear, this is my personal experience, but it has been corroborated by university chaplains, imams, people who studied and trained alongside Emirati students, as well as by family and friends who encountered them in the taxi, food and dining trade.

In short, it is not the “Muslim Brotherhood” the UAE fears. What it fears is its youth interacting with practising, educated British/Western Muslims who take their faith seriously, and who often possess a firmer grounding in basic Islamic fundamentals and global Muslim affairs than most secularised Emirati youth.

In my experience, Emirati students were unlike any other Arab/Muslim international students: reclusive, socially withdrawn, and largely disconnected from wider Muslim campus or local community life. Some even dressed and styled themselves like Black American rappers, which I found strange.

The very few I did speak to about religion and politics were highly critical not only of the Muslim Brotherhood, but also of Saudi Arabia and Salafism, and Israel and Palestine were simply a no-go discussion.

Whatever the case, Britain will not lose any sleep over Emirati students not coming to the UK; there are enough GCC students and Gulf money in British universities.

Lastly, there’s also a growing perception among Muslims across Europe and the West that the UAE is basically a Zionist subordinate of Israel with a perennialist reformist agenda, and that some of their students could actually be security services assets sent to infiltrate and gather intelligence on Western Muslim communities and Arab international students."""
