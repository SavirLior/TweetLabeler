""CIA OFFICER ON PLOT TO KILL LUMUMBA 

January 17 marks 65 years since the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s first democratically elected prime minister and one of Africa’s most powerful independence leaders. Lumumba’s death remains one of the darkest and most consequential episodes in Congolese and African history.

Lumumba came to power in 1960 as the DRC emerged from brutal Belgian colonial rule. A fierce advocate of national sovereignty, pan-African unity and self-determination, he challenged Western control over Congo’s vast resources and refused to be politically subservient. As a result he was overthrown and imprisoned in a coup by army chief Joseph Mobutu backed by Belgium and the US only a few months after taking power. 

Lumumba was later tortured and executed by a Katangan firing squad under the supervision of Belgian officers. To erase his legacy, his body was dismembered and dissolved in acid, leaving no grave that could become a site of resistance. In 2022, Belgium returned a single tooth, the only remaining part of his body, to his family for burial in Kinshasa.

The clip referenced here comes from the documentary Inside the CIA: On Company Business. In it, former CIA officer John Stockwell alleges that CIA station chief Larry Devlin had been involved in plans to poison Lumumba, before a military coup was ultimately chosen as the preferred method of removal. The interview offers a rare, chilling insight into the covert operations and foreign interference that sealed Lumumba’s fate and reshaped the future of the Congo.

Lumumba’s story is indeed telling of the malicious nature of foreign powers and how they suppressed post-independence Pan-African movements across the continent. But much like Nkrumah and Sankara, Lumumba’s ideas lived on and continue to inspire revolutionaries around the world.

He speaks in a fictional ‘we’ that exists only in Persian nationalist imagination, not in Iran’s lived reality. As a Sunni Iranian, this is immediately obvious, and it is obvious to anyone inside Iran who is not mainstream Persian. This includes even Shia groups who have largely lost a distinct identity and have been absorbed into Persian nationalism, such as many Azeris, Lors, and Caspian Iranians. 

This constant talk about Iran being uniquely special with natural borders is not some shared civilisational instinct. It is a standard modern Iranian nationalist myth, repeated so relentlessly that the average Iranian mistakes it for ancient truth, they actually believe they are special not realising they are not even the oldest civilisation in the Middle East. 

The irony is that both camps, i.e. Khomeinists and Shahists  that pretend to oppose each other fully embrace it Persian nationalist fairy tales. Yes, zealot hardcore  Khomeinists, the ideological heirs of the Safavids, and monarchists are united at the core. They quarrel over aesthetics, turbans versus crowns, but the substance is identical. Questioning the current borders is treated like apostasy, as if Iran itself were sacred. For many of them, it genuinely is, worshipped alongside God if not above Him (even in their everyday language one can observe that).

Everyone can destroy them with basic historical facts: the claim about ancient natural borders is laughable. It is pure myth making and cope on steroids. Geography has never magically produced legitimate states. Mountains and deserts were never sacred civilisational walls. They were zones of movement, trade, war, and overlap. The Zagros was a corridor for Arabs, Kurds, Lurs, Elamites (who were not Iranian in any ethnic sense), and Mesopotamian peoples for thousands of years. It was never a holy Iranian fence. Pretending otherwise is modern nationalist projection read backwards into history. But try to clarify these basics to them and they chimp out. 

Tey to explain to them that
Iran’s current borders did not descend from antiquity. They were violently hammered into shape under the  Safavids (Khomeini and Khamenei's salaf i.e. predecessors) and later reinforced by Qajar and Pahlavi centralisation through war, forced assimilation, and sectarian coercion as I already mentioned. Even when the rulers were Turco Persian, like the Safavids and Qajars, the project remained Persian nationalist and Shia supremacist, using sect and Persian identity to crush minorities, especially Sunnis. Borders shifted constantly and Sunnis and non Persian peoples were absorbed by force, not consent. For Sunnis, Kurds, Baloch, Arabs, and others, these borders were never inherited with pride. Never. They were imposed with blood, exclusion, and humiliation. This is precisely why both Khomeinists and Pahlavists are rightfully deeply resented among these communities.

What is telling is that this Iranian nationalist arrogance comes from insecurity. A multi ethnic state that does not match its ethnic or linguistic reality needs a myth of inevitability to survive. So conquest is rebranded as geography and coercion as civilisation. Older Middle Eastern peoples do not need this fantasy to justify themselves. Iranian nationalism does, because without it the entire story collapses.

The idea that monarchists, reformists, and hardliners would all unite to defend this map only proves the point. Different costumes, same ideology.

What makes this worse is not ignorant masses repeating these myths, but an Iranian elite that actively manufactures and teaches them to children as unquestionable fact. I heard these fairy tales constantly growing up, alongside open contempt for Arabs and Afghans and absurd fantasies about Iran belonging next to Austria and Switzerland. This is not pride. It is denial dressed up as history."
"To add one more thing: Iranian nationalists always ignore is a map they can never answer. The average Iranian is not even aware of this basic fact, and once you see it, the fairy tale of a uniquely ordained Iran with natural borders uniting Aryans since antiquity collapses. But as a starter, Iranian speaking peoples did not even originate on the Iranian plateau at all. They migrated into it. Before them, the Elamites were already there, non Iranian in language and identity, with a civilisation LONG predating the arrival of Iranians. The same applies to Kurds, who long predate the modern Iranian state and were later absorbed into a Persian nationalist project they never consented to.
The geology alone destroys the myth. The Arabian plate penetrates deep into what is now called Iran. Ahwaz, historically known as Arabistan even under the Safavids, sits on the Arabian plate, not the Iranian microcontinent. That is why its climate, landscape, and historical orientation align with Mesopotamia and Arabia, not the Persian heartlands. This is not ideology. It is geology. These are factsz simple as.
The same fantasy is imposed on Kurdish lands. The Zagros was never a sacred Persian boundary. It was a zone of movement and autonomy for Kurds and other highland peoples, later subdued through conquest and centralisation.

So when Iranian nationalists talk about natural borders, what they really mean is simple. These are territories they conquered early enough that they now pretend geography itself demanded it. This is not destiny. It is conquest rewritten as nature."

Like his companion, Imam Luqman Abdullah, who preceded him, these were men who, in shā’Allāh, remained steadfast and true to their covenant with Allāh. They stood in stark contrast to many other “imams” in the West, who faltered and compromised.

Though they may not have been formally recognized as ulama, they—in shā’Allāh—acted upon the knowledge they possessed, which is what truly matters. نَحْسُبُهُمْ كَذَلِك، وَاللَّهُ حَسِيبُهُمْ، وَلَا نُزَكِّي عَلَى اللَّهِ أَحَدًا. Even amid his suffering, Imam Jamil remained thoughtful, conveying his salām to me through some who were in touch with him.

May Allāh forgive them both, envelop them in His infinite mercy, illuminate their graves with radiant light, and elevate their ranks among the righteous.
