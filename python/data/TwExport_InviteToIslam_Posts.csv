"2001400136463987193","Truth Demands Firmness. When Met With Leniency, the Ummah Fades into Ruin.

During the Khilāfah of ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه), a man called Subaigh Ibn ‘Asal came to Madinah and asked persistently about the Mutashābihāt. 

ʿUmar (رضي الله عنه) summoned him and struck him until his head bled. Subaigh then said, “Enough, O Commander of the Faithful! What I used to find in my head has now gone.”

‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) then exiled him to Basra and wrote to its people, “Do not sit with him.”

Years later, when the Khawārij emerged, they invited Subaigh to join them and become a leader. Look at his response:

“Far be it! Allah has benefited me through the admonition of the righteous man, the Commander of the Faithful, ʿUmar (رضي الله عنه).”

Subaigh remained humbled until his death, after once been noble. 

We need men like ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه). Through firm discipline, exile, and social restriction, ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) cut off a potential source of deviation, encouraged Subaigh’s repentance, and set an example for all who stubbornly questioned that which brought no benefit.

His own trials only strengthened his resolve to help others. Anytime Allah resolved a conflict through him, he rejoiced, celebrating and weeping in joy.

When we spoke to the Shaykh during this health crisis, may Allah protect him, he did not complain once. Though his voice bore the weight of fatigue, he spoke with unwavering strength, constantly praising Allah.

"1992784540075475229","Imam Jamil Al-Amin passed away today while still confined within the prison walls. Like his companion, Imam Luqman Abdullah, who preceded him, these were men who, in shā’Allāh, remained steadfast and true to their covenant with Allāh. They stood in stark contrast to many other “imams” in the West, who faltered and compromised.

Though they may not have been formally recognized as ulama, they—in shā’Allāh—acted upon the knowledge they possessed, which is what truly matters. نَحْسُبُهُمْ كَذَلِك، وَاللَّهُ حَسِيبُهُمْ، وَلَا نُزَكِّي عَلَى اللَّهِ أَحَدًا. Even amid his suffering, Imam Jamil remained thoughtful, conveying his salām to me through some who were in touch with him.

May Allāh forgive them both, envelop them in His infinite mercy, illuminate their graves with radiant light, and elevate their ranks among the righteous.

"1983657744889450754","The Ṭawāghīt of the UAE
🎯To the Yahūd, they bow and extend allegiance through the Abraham Accords, a modern veil for walāʾ to the Yahūd and global powers.
🎯To the Naṣārā, they offer the so-called Abrahamic House.
🎯To the mushrikīn, they open their doors, erecting Hindu temples and idols.
🎯But to the Muslimīn, in Al-Fashir, in Sudan, and beyond, they send funding, weapons, and aid, fueling slaughter, spreading terror, and staining the earth with innocent blood. They build palaces for their enemies while digging graves for their own.

As the poet once said:
وكم عند الحكومة من رجال
تراهم سادة وهم العبيد
كلاب للأجانب هم ولكن
على أبناءِ جِلدتهم أسود
How many serve the throne,
masked as masters, yet chained as slaves?
Dogs before enemy,
fierce as wolves against their own.

These events reveal not the rulers themselves, their servitude to the enemies of Islam has long been clear. Rather, they expose the shuyūkh who defend them, legitimize them, and the deluded followers who anoint such tyrants as “legitimate rulers,” labeling all who resist them as khawārij.

And above all, they expose the West’s hypocrisy: when the executioner is a friend of the US and the Yahūd, when Sharīʿah is flouted, and the victims are Muslim, the world does nothing. No coalition of 89 nations rises; no outrage is voiced; no terror labels are issued. Silence becomes policy. Indifference becomes law.

May Allah protect our brothers and sisters in Al-Fashir, shield them from harm, grant them patience, and preserve their faith; and may He hold accountable those who oppress them or aid their oppressors.

"1983378930154299740","Al-Fashir has become the new Gaza, a genocide unfolding in plain sight while the world remains silent. The people there endure horrors as grave as, if not worse than, those faced by our brothers and sisters in Gaza, and comparable to the atrocities that Syrians suffered under Bashar’s tyranny.

This injustice cannot go unnoticed. It demands global outrage and unwavering solidarity from Muslims everywhere.

Behind this oppression stands the UAE’s corrupt and wicked ṭāghūt, Muhammad ibn Zayed, arming, funding, and supporting killers, spreading tyranny from one land to another.

O Allah, he has transgressed throughout the land and spread corruption, so unleash upon him every form of severe punishment.
Protect our brothers and sisters in Al-Fashir, and safeguard all those oppressed around the world.

"1977125590403891704","During the past Ramadan, amidst many events and responsibilities, I found myself one day hesitant to visit my mother, may Allah forgive her and grant her  Firdaws. Fatigue had set in, and the schedule was overwhelming. Yet I felt unusually compelled to go, it was Friday, after ‘Asr, and something in my heart told me I must.

Upon arriving, I noticed two young brothers waiting patiently nearby. They approached me, and one of them told me he had learned that this visit was part of my daily routine. He had researched the cemetery, located my mother’s grave in that vast space, found the exact plot, and had been waiting there for most of the day, after traveling by plane solely to meet me.
May Allah forgive my mother, grant her al-Firdaws, and reward these brothers.

He told me he had made du‘ā to meet me, based on a certain stipulation about me: if our meeting was the answer to his du‘ā due to that specific condition, it would be all I could wish for dunya and akhira.

At the time, I was hesitant, this is, after all, a confirmed tactic the FBI has used dozens of times to entrap me. And I was also too occupied to sit with him properly, so he extended his stay. When I finally sat with him, saw his radiant face (Allāhumma bārik lahu), and heard his questions, I regretted not having dropped everything earlier to spend all my time with him.

His manners were remarkable, truly beyond his years. He was very young, only 18. His questions were the kind you love to hear: thoughtful, sincere, and filled with a genuine desire for knowledge. He wasn’t manhaj-shopping or hopping, nor was he chasing controversies or indulging in te back-and-forth games. He came to learn the dīn of Allah with humility and seriousness, and Allah knows best what is in the hearts.

As I dropped him off at the airport, I advised him to begin following the lessons, since he mentioned he hadn’t kept up with all the classes. He took that advice sincerely, he began studying and taking notes. Today, a video was sent to me of him completing the Tawheed class.

As he was leaving, he handed me a beautifully bound notebook filled with poems he had written, for me and about me. Allah is my witness: I am not worthy of a single letter within its pages. Yet it spoke volumes about the kind of heart he possesses.
O Allah, make me better than they think of me, forgive me for what they do not know, and do not hold me accountable for what they say.

When he would send me questions, months might pass before I could respond, yet he would wait patiently. May Allah bless him and forgive me for my shortcomings toward him.

When a debate was later announced, he didn’t play foolish games seeking attention, nor did he cozy up with the enemies, serving their evil agenda while pretending to be on the side of the truth. Instead, he knew his duty, simple and clear: to stand behind the truth.

Out of the hundreds of emails, texts, and calls I receive daily, he was, in fact, the only one who privately sent me a du‘ā by text regarding this matter, one that I woke up to. It was so beautifully worded, so sincere and heartfelt, that it genuinely soothed my heart.

It reminded me of the story of Qutaybah ibn Muslim and the du‘ā of Muḥammad ibn Wāsiʿ.
Ibn al-Jawzī mentioned in Ṣifat al-Ṣafwah that Muḥammad ibn Wāsiʿ was once with Qutaybah ibn Muslim in an army. Qutaybah was the governor of Khurāsān at the time, and the Turks had come out to confront them. So Qutaybah sent someone to the Masjid to see who was there. He was told, “No one is there except Muḥammad ibn Wāsiʿ, raising his finger in duaa'.”
Qutaybah then said:
“That finger of his is more beloved to me than thirty thousand cavalry.”
And in Siyar Aʿlām al-Nubalāʾ, Imām al-Dhahabī reported that Qutaybah said:
“That finger is more beloved to me than one hundred thousand drawn swords and strong young fighters.”

I ask Allah to reward his parents for such a noble upbringing, to keep him and his family steadfast, and to make him an ‘ālim and an imām of the Muslimeen.
May Allah honor me and surround me with such brothers. It is men of such character who, by the will of Allah, will be the catalysts of the awaited victory.
 
Once he completes what I advised him to pursue, it is brothers like this, sincere, disciplined, and grounded, whom I would be honored to teach. In fact, I would be the one asking to teach them.

On a side note: Many brothers have traveled from across the U.S., and even from abroad—to visit. May Allah reward the sincere among them. However, please only do so with my personal approval. I am not like others who have the support of Masaajid, means, resources, or the ease to accommodate so many visitors or students.
