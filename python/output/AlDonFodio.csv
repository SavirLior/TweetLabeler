Its without a doubt now that Shaykhul Islam meant here that 

‘the one who replaces the Shari’ah is a kafir by ijma. As proven by [ayah of hukm in Ma’idah], as tabdil = istibdal = istihlal which is kufr’"

""🧵 The Wahhābī assault on Karbalāʾ: A complete history

I think Daniel Haqiqatjou might be suffering from a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, he keeps getting rinsed with the facts but insists on coming back for another round with the sandal 🩴.

In any case, this thread is a comprehensive history of the Wahhābī assault on Karbalāʾ in 1802.

[1] The Ottoman violation of the treaty between them and the First Saudi State
[2] The Shīʾī attack on a group of civilian Wahhābī caravans
[3] The Ottomans’ refusal to punish the perpetrators
[4] The Saudi advance towards Karbalāʾ
[5] The Wahhābīs did not attack civilians
[6] Karbalāʾ had become a refuge for worst elements in society
[7] The Wahhābī assault only lasted for a few hours"""

""Saʾūd Ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz was to the First Saudi State what Khālid Ibn al-Walīd was to the Khulafāʾ al-Rāshidīn.

Saʾūd was a man of great piety and jealousy for the religion of Allāh, a leader who would always seek peace and would never violate an agreement.

Yet when he fought, he fought hard. He was a military genius who never lost a battle, a commander whose bravery was unmatched, a leader whose letters and actions struck fear into the hearts of the enemy.

His campaigns were nothing but major successes for the daʾwah, leading his soldiers from victory to victory, conquering land after land.

He passed in 1814, four years before the destruction of the First Saudi State in 1818, at the ripe old age of 66.

I personally believe that had Saʾūd lived to witness the campaign of Ibrāhīm Pāshā against al-Dirʿiyyah, the Wahhābīs would’ve been victorious. Ultimately we accept whatever the decree of Allāh brings."""
