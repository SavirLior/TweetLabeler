""BREAKING! U.S. federal appeals court has thrown out all remaining convictions of Sheikh Ali al-Timimi 

A federal appeals court has thrown out all remaining criminal convictions against Sheikh Dr Ali al-Timimi, effectively bringing an end to 20 of incarceration (15 of them under maximum security solitary confinement), as well as 5 years under house arrest. 

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Sheikh Dr. Ali al-Timimi's convictions after ruling he engaged in constitutionally protected free speech and did not violate any laws.

Judge James Wynn wrote in a unanimous opinion for a three-judge panel. “The First Amendment’s protection does not depend on the popularity or palatability of the message conveyed. On the contrary, it is most vital when speech offends, disturbs, or challenges prevailing sensibilities.”

The appeals court said Dr. Al-Timimi’s suggestions to his associates were not “concrete” enough to cross the line into criminal conduct.

“Because the Constitution forbids criminal punishment for protected advocacy—however odious the content of that advocacy—we conclude that Al-Timimi’s speech remained protected under the First Amendment.”

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who represented Dr. Al-Timimi for 17 years, stated, “It stands as one of the longest direct appeals in history. The case raised troubling due process and free speech issues,” Turley said, crediting (Federal Defender Geremy) Kamens for the successful result.

An argument can be made (if it is not already the standard), that anyone who defends/openly supports the UAE government, his Islam is in question (as the default), due to their open Shirk and Kufr, as well as their open enmity towards True Islam.

""I often wonder if this guy in particular is diagnosed with some sort of mental illness, learning deficiency, because his “gotcha” comments would be better served being featured on a charity commercial for learning disability centers, rather than actual theological discourse.

To explain simply to this moronic Jahmi Mushrik:

They believed to the effect that they acknowledged that the Creator, the Sustainer, and the One who controls and facilitates the finality of the affairs, etc. — is Allah سبحانه وتعالى.

Al-Qurṭubī states in his Tafsīr:

قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى: ﴿وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُمْ مُشْرِكُونَ﴾
نَزَلَتْ فِي قَوْمٍ أَقَرُّوا بِاللَّهِ خَالِقِهِمْ وَخَالِقِ الْأَشْيَاءِ كُلِّهَا، وَهُمْ يَعْبُدُونَ الْأَوْثَانَ، قَالَهُ الْحَسَنُ وَمُجَاهِدٌ وَعَامِرُ الشَّعْبِيُّ، وَأَكْثَرُ الْمُفَسِّرِينَ.

“His saying, Exalted is He: ‘And most of them do not believe in Allah except while they associate partners with Him.’
It was revealed concerning a people who acknowledged Allah as their Creator and the Creator of all things, yet they worshipped idols. This was stated by al-Ḥasan, Mujāhid, ʿĀmir al-Shaʿbī, and the majority of the mufassirīn.”

Imām al-Ṭabarī also narrates in his Tafsir:

حَدَّثَنَا بِشْرٌ، قَالَ، حَدَّثَنَا يَزِيدُ، قَالَ، حَدَّثَنَا سَعِيدٌ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، قَوْلُهُ: ﴿وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُمْ مُشْرِكُونَ﴾، فِي إِيمَانِهِمْ هَذَا.
إِنَّكَ لَسْتَ تَلْقَى أَحَدًا مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا أَنْبَأَكَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ رَبُّهُ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُ وَرَزَقَهُ، وَهُوَ مُشْرِكٌ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ.

“You do not encounter any one of them except that he informs you that Allah is his Rabb, and that He is the One who created him and provided for him—yet he is a polytheist in his worship.”

Pay attention to his tie-in with believing Allah is The Rabb, and believing Allah is the Creator, etc.

The distinction of shirk in worship (i.e., shirk in ulūhiyyah) and Rubūbiyyah is further clarified in the Qurʾān, where Allah Says about the same mushrikīn who said in response to the Prophet:

أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَهًا وَاحِدًا

“Has he made the gods into one single god?”

Imām al-Ṭabarī comments in his Tafsīr:

يَقُولُ: وَقَالَ هَؤُلَاءِ الْكَافِرُونَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا: مُحَمَّدٌ سَاحِرٌ كَذَّابٌ:
أَجَعَلَ مُحَمَّدٌ الْمَعْبُودَاتِ كُلَّهَا وَاحِدًا، يَسْمَعُ دُعَاءَنَا جَمِيعًا، وَيَعْلَمُ عِبَادَةَ كُلِّ عَابِدٍ عَبَدَهُ مِنَّا؟
﴿إِنَّ هَذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ﴾، أَيْ إِنَّ هَذَا لَشَيْءٌ عَجِيبٌ.

“He says: These disbelievers—who said, ‘Muḥammad is a sorcerer, a liar’—said:
Has Muḥammad made all the objects of worship one single object of worship, who hears all of our supplications and knows the worship of every worshipper among us?
‘Indeed, this is something astonishing,’ meaning: something extremely strange.”

These same mushrikīn believed that Allah is the only Creator, the only Sustainer, and the only One who controls the finality of the affairs, yet they worshipped other than Allah — according to Imām al-Ṭabarī, “the Wahhābī.”

TL;DR for the brain-dead Jahmi Mushrik:

You can believe in Allah as The Rabb, yet still shirk Him as the Only Illah (معبرد). Two Ayat is all it took to understand this."""
