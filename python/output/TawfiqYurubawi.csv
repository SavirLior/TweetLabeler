""@anwarphilly May Allah reward Sh Abdullah alBukhari for his beneficial books and teaching. Like all scholars his honour is kept since he is from the scholars of Ahlu Sunnah. We love all the scholars of Ahlu Sunnah from those that taught us like Sh Muhammad alBanna and Sh Ubayd رحمهم الله"""

""The real question to Iranians may be: is it the religion that oppresses, or is it the way a particular interpretation is imposed and enforced by those in power? 

There’s no doubt that Persia had its own rich civilization and deep intellectual traditions long before the arrival of Islam to the empire.

However, we should note that Persians were also among the peoples involved in the army that took over the Sasanian Empire. It wasn’t a purely “Arab” army. There were in Arabs, Persians, Ethiopians, and others in that army. 

Then, Persians embraced Islam and contributed enormously - through scholarship, governance, literature, and the sciences to the growth and enrichment of the Islamic world. For 1400 years, no Iranian/Persian blamed the religion. 

Moreover, Iranians did not view Islam itself as the problem prior to Khomeini’s rise. If you ask secular Iranians who lived during the Shah’s reign (or earlier), many will tell you their issue was not with the faith as a personal religion, they had no problem with it. So what changed?

By contrast, you rarely hear citizens of countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia - where they generally follow the teachings of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, say they want to flee because of Islam itself. 

That comparison is something worth reflecting on."""
