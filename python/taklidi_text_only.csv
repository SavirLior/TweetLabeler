Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Firabri said:

So I said: There is none of these, may Allah have mercy on you, except that I see myself in a better state.

"It is said: “الصراخ على قدر الألم” — a phrase suggesting that the intensity of a scream corresponds to the level of pain experienced.

After years of producing PDFs that delved into the realms of scholars and rulers—encroaching on their rights, stirring negativity against them, and diminishing their standing in the eyes of the public—followed by strange cycles of repentance followed by retraction from them, and targeting students one after another, the affair then reaching its peak with a disgraceful public attack on al-‘Allāmah al-Bukhārī, حفظه الله تعالى….when rebuttal finally arrived, regrettably, uncontrollable cries are heard…

I advise all intelligent Salafīs to remain focused on their studies and to benefit from our scholars—those who have spent years, even decades, dedicated to teaching through thousands of audios, lectures, books, writings, and khutbas, by the blessing of Allāh. Among them are the likes of al-‘Allāmah al-Bukhārī and Shaikh ‘Arafāt, may Allāh preserve them.

On the other hand, one should consider it troubling that there are those who only become known and raised by others in times of fitnah—without prior recognition for their contributions in the field of knowledge itself.

Discerning great scholars the likes of al-‘Allāmah Rabī & al-‘Allāmah ‘Ubayd رحمهما الله knew exactly who to recommend and put forward—the likes of al-‘Allāmah al-Bukhārī & Shaikh ‘Arafāt among others. They saw what is clear and evident; that they are people who are focused on knowledge and its teaching, and have been for years, even decades, known and recognised for that—something that no-one in the West ever denied, until the grievances of one man opened up chaos and a terrible trajectory for gullible and naive youngsters. 

May Allāh guide our brother Abū ‘Iyād so that he may return from his new disastrous path, 30 years of involvement in da’wah to be wasted like this is a great shame; but it has happened to others before, those far far greater in standing and status than him, we hope it will not end the same for him."

""S͟hayk͟h @Arafatbinhassan Al-Muḥammadī's Comments on The Defenders of S͟hayk͟h ʿAbdullāh @dr_albukhary (may Allāh preserve them both)

The Questioner: May Allāh give good to you, our S͟hayk͟h ʿArafāt. Today, S͟hayk͟h Abul-Ḥasan Mālik @IbnAkhdar Al-Amrīkī published his defense of the ʿAllāmah ʿAbdullāh Al-Buk͟hārī, and some other callers (duʿāt), such as S͟hayk͟h @anwarphilly Al-Amrīkī, have also shared it. However, some brothers are criticizing them for a lack of clarity because they did not explicitly mention the name of Abū ʿIyāḍ. What is your advice, our S͟hayk͟h, for these brothers?

The S͟hayk͟h: May Allāh reward our noble brother Abul-Ḥasan with goodness for his defense and safeguarding of the honour of our S͟hayk͟h, Al-ʿAllāmah ʿAbdullāh Al-Buk͟hārī, may Allāh preserve him. There is no need for him to mention anyone by name. For whoever attacks the firmly grounded scholars is among those who have boarded the ship of the people of innovation and misguidance. And whoever attacks our S͟hayk͟h, Al-ʿAllāmah ʿAbdullāh Al-Buk͟hārī, is weak in intellect and sick in soul.

As for this lost and sick individual whom you mentioned in your question, his attacks against the scholars and the rulers have been established as he claimed that the Arab states “emerged from the desert”!

In reality, states are led only by those in authority, and those in authority are the scholars and the rulers, as stated by the Salaf, including Ibn ʿAbbās (may Allāh be pleased with him).

So, is mentioning the word “desert” a form of praise for the scholars and the rulers, or is it a form of disparagement? We leave the answer to the people of intellect.

Or does he mean by “Arab states” the walls, the buildings, and lifeless things? Or does he mean the bakers and the shop owners?

{Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful.} (Sūrah Al-An ʿām: 6:143)

And the strange thing is that he claimed the Arab states have gone to imitate the West!! As if this strange creature lives inside the Kaʿbah.

We have condemned him by what he uttered with his own tongue; through his speech, he discarded the fatwas of the scholars regarding contemporary issues, following the methodology of Safar Al-Ḥawālī and Salmān Al- ʿAwdah. Then he repented, but later he broke his repentance!

It is enough of a disgrace and a shame for him that he plays with repentance like a wandering sheep between two flocks; and this is among the traits of the people of hypocrisy! For the believer is simple hearted and noble, while the hypocrite is deceitful and wicked.

The Questioner: May Allāh reward you with goodness, our S͟hayk͟h, for your advice. Do you permit me to publish it for the brothers?

The S͟hayk͟h: As you wish.

The Questioner: May Allāh reward you with goodness, our S͟hayk͟h.

""📍 Advice &amp; Statement from @SalafiDawaLancs regarding the regrettable writings of our brother Abū ‘Iyād Amjad Rafīq attacking al-‘Allāmah Shaikh ‘Abdullāh al-Bukhārī حفظه الله تعالى

PDF here:"
"[Retweeted]
""The tremendous virtue and vast knowledge of al-Allāmah Sheikh Abdullāh al-Bukharī حفظه الله is known amongst the scholars of Sunnah, and the people of Sunnah across the globe. 

His standing is recognised by great scholars, past and present, including the great imāms: Sheikh ʿUbayd al-Jābarī رحمه الله and Sheikh Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī رحمه الله. 

It is well known that Sheikh Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī رحمه الله said about him: “he is from the best of the people of Sunnah, and from those who constantly defend it as far as I know. The majority of those who fight against him are from the people of desires… he is one of the most knowledgeable of the Salafi methodology”.

The commendations for the Sheikh are well-known and widespread.

Below is the well-known widespread and clear advice of our Sheikh, the Imām, ʿUbayd al-Jābarī رحمه الله shortly before he passed away, guided and encouraged us to benefit from Sheikh Abdullāh al-Bukharī and Sheikh Arafāt al-Muhammadī حفظهما الله:



We ask Allāh to preserve them upon the truth, and continue to make them both an immense benefit for the people of Sunnah.

Anyone who has claims, unresolved grievances or reservations regarding our Sheikh, a scholar from the people of Sunnah, should present them to him and the scholars. This is the path of the sincere seeker of truth, those truly seeking to unite the hearts of the people of Sunnah. 

As for those who freely unleash their tongues or pens against the scholars, the people of virtue and knowledge, attempting to reduce their status, then their claims and statements are not given consideration."""
"“…it is feared it may only be a matter of time before Shaytān deceives you further into attacking al-‘Allāmah al-Bukhārī by name….”

Matters often unfold gradually: first, an elder Salafī dā‘ī is branded a liar against Allāh; then a senior student of the scholars—an ‘ālim in his own right, as al-‘Allāmah ‘Ubayd رحمه الله affirmed—is accused of being a kadhāb, along with a catalogue of other allegations. When that still proves insufficient, another is maligned by a tongue devoid of restraint, until the affair escalates to the point that even senior scholars—figures of the stature of al-‘Allāmah ‘Abdullāh al-Bukhārī—are not spared.

May Allāh forgive our brother Abū ‘Iyād and return him to the goodness that was once known of him…may he be given success in abandoning this disgraceful path he now treads upon of attacking our senior scholars and their students.

My previous advice to our brother Abū ‘Iyād & those supporting him—may Allāh rectify him:

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, a lot of important topics discussed in the lectures from Sahīh al-Bukhārī, as well as in other gatherings—with an emphasis on the importance of respecting our Scholars and returning to them for guidance and advice in our affairs to keep fitan away from our communities.

May Allāh reward all the organisers, everyone who participated from the brothers and sisters in the logistics in any way, and give them success in strengthening & progressing with the da’wah there—classes/events in Dutch are held with our brother Ustādh Gamal bin Rabī @DeQuran, as well as in Albanian with several students including the respected elder brother Ustādh Abū Saīd Jamāl Ya’qūbī @Xhemal_Jakupi

""Its clear. Salafis want ilm &amp; ulamaa, knowledge &amp; scholars to clarify for them. They want teachers who have spent real time at the feet of scholars, to share knowledge &amp; manners. They are sick of social media controversy, false accusations &amp; obnoxious egotism. Al-hamdu lillah."""

""Some people on social media: 

Pass Fatawa about global events like senior scholars. 

Discuss military matters like generals.

Issue directives like rulers. 

Amazingly they fall into none of these categories. 

The semi qualified (or unqualified) are responsible for the chaos."""
"Alhamdulillāh we started the weekend program in Belgium at Masjid al-Albānī @MoskeeElAlbani with Jumu’ah khutbah.

It is a very welcoming and warm diverse community, and a very significantly sized masjid may Allāh bless it."

""Poetry the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) Used to Quote: Time Reveals All in Due Course

سَتُبْدِي لك الأيّام ما كُنْتَ جاهلا
ويأتيك بالأخبار مَنْ لم تُزَوِّدِ

“The days will reveal to you what you did not know,
and news will come to you from someone you didn’t send (to gather news).”

Aisha (radiyallahu anha) said: “When news was slow in reaching the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), he used to quote these lines of poetry by [the Arab poet] Tarafah. (Musnad Ahmad)

The meaning is: the news you seek will come to you from one whom you did not task or ask, so you should not be hasty, for the news will come to you eventually."""

واقعۂ اسراء و معراج کی صحیح اور متعین رات معلوم نہیں، اور اگر بالفرض یہ رات معلوم بھی ہو، تب بھی اس کی کوئی خاص تقریب یا جشن منانا جائز نہیں۔۔۔
