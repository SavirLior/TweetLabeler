""My Iranians - especially those who have been conditioned to believe that the religion promoted by Iran's rulers represents Islam,

Our grandparents, your great-grandparents, and our families believed in Islam. They prayed, they fasted, and they practiced the religion according what they knew Islam to be. During their time - especially under the Shah, there was no widespread hatred toward Islam, nor a culture of mass atheism. Do you not see  the Qur’an placed on the Haft-Seen table at Nowruz?

What they knew Islam to be, as it was lived then, was not experienced as oppression.

Iranians of that era - even those who were not strictly observant, respected mosques, teachers, and religious life. The Shah himself was secular, yet he identified as a Muslim. Sunnis practiced according to their tradition, Shiʿa according to theirs, and those who did not pray at all still respected those who did. Faith was allowed to exist naturally within society - without fear, coercion, or ideological policing.

Did you forget the Shah’s marriage to Princess Fawzia of Egypt. Was she not an Arab? Was she not Muslim? And when he was later exiled, sick with cancer, was it not a Muslim country - Egypt, that accepted him, treated him, and welcomed his burial. Not America. Not Britain. Not France.

Then came the rupture.

What was imposed on Iran after 1979 was not Islam as our ancestors knew it. It was Rafidhism - an ideology alien to the spiritual temperament, cultural memory, and historical pluralism of the Iranian people and most importantly true Islam. Under the banner of religion, a system was constructed that stripped people of dignity, criminalised dissent, and turned faith into an instrument of domination. This was not a natural religious evolution. It was an ideological seizure of power.

Any traits of Islam that we had, was no longer lived. but the ideas of Khomeini were installed.

This shift is captured in the following narration of Shaykh Ḥammād ibn Muḥammad al-Anṣārī:  

“I heard my father say: ‘The shah was secular, and Meenī (as he pronounced it), by which he meant Khomeini, was a Rāfiḍī. During the time of the Shah, students from Iran used to come to the university, and I myself encountered them. Then, when they returned to Iran after completing their university studies, Khomeini’s government - which came to power after the Shah - arrested them.’ 

I said: That is, my father meant that during the time of the Shah, the Rāfiḍīs did not hold power or authority, and therefore the Sunnis among the people of Iran lived in relative ease and security.” - Kitāb al-Majmūʿ fī Tarjamat al-ʿAllāmah al-Muḥaddith al-Shaykh Ḥammād ibn Muḥammad al-Anṣārī

Iran possesses the third-largest oil reserves in the world. Western powers did not remove the Shah out of concern for Iranian freedom or religious authenticity. They exploited the upheaval. They tolerated, and in key moments enabled - the rise of a Rafidhi regime Khomeinim - who was an indian by origin, because it served their interests: a controllable enemy, a destabilised region, and a population divided against itself.

The ideology that suffocated Iran from within was Rafidhism not Islam. And this is the greatest tragedy of all.

Islam that you knew - once respected, lived naturally, and woven into Iranian life, became associated in the minds of many Iranians with hypocrisy and oppression. This did not come from Islam itself. It did not come from ordinary Muslims, Sunnis, or Arabs. It came from Rafidhism, merged with state power, and ruled in God’s name while crushing God’s creation.

So ask yourselves:

If Islam were the problem, why did the majority of Iranians who left Iran before 1979 flee to Sunni Muslim lands such as Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE - and integrate into those societies and cultures without conflict?

Why do we not hear Iranians of these countries speak against Islam? Why is it only those who live in LA, London or Paris?

If Islam were the issue, why do we not hear citizens of the Gulf Arab countries, nor Muslims in Indonesia or Malaysia - complaining that their religion has ruined their lives or stripped them of dignity?

These societies are Muslim. Their people pray, fast, and live within an Islamic framework, yet religion there is not experienced as a prison, nor as a constant source of fear and humiliation.

Islam is not the problem. Rafidhism is."""

Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Firabri said:

One day, Imam al-Bukhari narrated to me a great number of hadiths, and he feared that I might become bored [or tired], so he said: ‘Be happy [and content], for those who spend their time on entertainment are busy with them, those skilled in crafts are busy with their work, and businessmen with their trade, while you are with the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions.”

So I said: There is none of these, may Allah have mercy on you, except that I see myself in a better state.
