Saʾūd was a man of great piety and jealousy for the religion of Allāh, a leader who would always seek peace and would never violate an agreement.

Yet when he fought, he fought hard. He was a military genius who never lost a battle, a commander whose bravery was unmatched, a leader whose letters and actions struck fear into the hearts of the enemy.

His campaigns were nothing but major successes for the daʾwah, leading his soldiers from victory to victory, conquering land after land.

He passed in 1814, four years before the destruction of the First Saudi State in 1818, at the ripe old age of 66.

I personally believe that had Saʾūd lived to witness the campaign of Ibrāhīm Pāshā against al-Dirʿiyyah, the Wahhābīs would’ve been victorious.
