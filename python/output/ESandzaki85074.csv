""Your source of information is ChatGPT. Lol. 

Its chain of narration is weak and cannot be used as evidence, and Mālik al-Dār is unknown.

As for the statement of Ibn Hajar  in al-Fatḥ:
Reported by Ibn Abī Shaybah with a sound chain from Abū Ṣāliḥ al-Sammān from Mālik al-Dār.

his intent is that the chain is sound up to Abū Ṣāliḥ only; he did not judge the entire chain to be sound.

Ibn Ḥajar also reported that Sayf narrated in al-Futūḥ that the one who saw the dream was the Companion Bilāl al-Muzanī. However, Sayf is Ibn ʿUmar al-Tamīmī al-Ḍabbī, one of the weak and abandoned narrators, as stated by al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar in al-Taqrīb."""
