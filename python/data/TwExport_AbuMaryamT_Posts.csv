"2011837027604402278","Imam Bukhari’s Advice to His Student: Knowledge is Better than Entertainment and Business

Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Firabri said:

One day, Imam al-Bukhari narrated to me a great number of hadiths, and he feared that I might become bored [or tired], so he said: ‘Be happy [and content], for those who spend their time on entertainment are busy with them, those skilled in crafts are busy with their work, and businessmen with their trade, while you are with the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions.”

So I said: There is none of these, may Allah have mercy on you, except that I see myself in a better state.
