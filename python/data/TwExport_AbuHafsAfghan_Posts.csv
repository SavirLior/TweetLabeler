"2010443669569249445","#AlQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has just released a startling 7-pager explaining why #Trump’s rule represents a historic opportunity for #jihad. Here’s a synopsis of what the jihadis are predicting & planning for:
▪️World is “sliding towards a third world war” which will change the map
▪️US soft power has gone; it’s now about brute force
▪️East-West conflict will weaken both
▪️#China, #Russia, #Iran, #Turkey & others who oppose the West cannot ally with al-Qaeda but will seek to benefit from its efforts. States “We will not enter into conflict with them at this stage unless they initiate it”. Fascinatingly, it adds: “Some of them may even provide support, but sparingly, cautiously, & deliberately, allowing us to survive”. But it warns jihad groups not to trust or rely on them.
▪️“Make America Great Again” will ultimately result in the collapse of #NATO, Europe & the entire West
▪️Predicts that “the foolish pirate Trump” will remain in power by cancelling elections or changing the constitution
▪️Trump’s “thuggish, colonial approach” & obsession with power will generate internal conflict that will further weaken the US
▪️Blames #Maduro’s failure on religious bankruptcy
▪️Societies (incl in Arab countries) will be divided by economic crises, growing inequality, consumerism (at the expense of development), loss of trust in leaders, disillusionment with institutions
▪️Jihad stands ready to harness growing global anger at “Zionist-Crusader arrogance”","en","Quoted","Elisabeth Kendall","Dr_E_Kendall","135533","36","190","61","442","400","2026-01-11 22:08:17","https://x.com/Dr_E_Kendall/status/2010443669569249445","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","#AlQaeda, #Trump, #jihad, #China, #Russia, #Iran, #Turkey, #NATO, #Maduro","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-aGwSNWcAE0SMc.jpg"

"2008068664097222929","I posted a week ago that IEA was extremely succesful to shut down ISIS-K in Afghanistan. ISIS-K was no match for IEA. They were crushed easily.

However in Syria it seems different. Ex-HTS members give bayah to the Daesh Caliph.

It seems like there are recruits &amp; defections. https://t.co/Vrit24ZGYo","en","Origin","Abu Hafs al-Khorasani ابوحفص الخراساني","AbuHafsAfghan","8348","15","2","2","29","27","2026-01-05 08:50:52","https://x.com/AbuHafsAfghan/status/2008068664097222929","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G94XWUUWIAEFQUL.png"

"2007888268268888305","It really looks like Africa is the next theatre for Jihadist centre. Literally most of AQ &amp; IS activities are in Africa.

Both AQ and IS decreased in Indian subcontinent, Khorasan and Middle East but have grown in Africa.

When Mullah died in 2015 - Syrian fighters offered condolences. However some of them called Mullah Umar as Ameer al Mumineen but some did not (meaning they never had bayah to Mullah Umar).
