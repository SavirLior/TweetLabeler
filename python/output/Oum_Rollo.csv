""قد أَذِنَ الله سبحانه وتعالى للمعتدى عليهم بالدفاع عن أنفسهم، ولا يحتاجون إذنا من أي حاكم نجس في الإمارات، ولا الحكام الأنجاس في بلاد الحرمين، ولا أي حاكم آخر في هذه المسالة!

{ أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا ۚ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ }."

""Al-Fashir has become the new Gaza, a genocide unfolding in plain sight while the world remains silent. The people there endure horrors as grave as, if not worse than, those faced by our brothers and sisters in Gaza, and comparable to the atrocities that Syrians suffered under Bashar’s tyranny.

This injustice cannot go unnoticed. It demands global outrage and unwavering solidarity from Muslims everywhere.

Behind this oppression stands the UAE’s corrupt and wicked ṭāghūt, Muhammad ibn Zayed, arming, funding, and supporting killers, spreading tyranny from one land to another.

O Allah, he has transgressed throughout the land and spread corruption, so unleash upon him every form of severe punishment.
Protect our brothers and sisters in Al-Fashir, and safeguard all those oppressed around the world.

For anyone saying, there is a lack of empathy in the responses — Per Charlie Kirk Oct 2022, “ I can’t stand the word empathy actually. I think empathy is a made-up, New Age term that — it does a lot of damage.”"

""@TPointUK Gun deaths are “worth it” to keep the 2nd amendment according to Charlie Kirk. He says it’s “a prudent deal. It’s rational”

203 kiddies gunned down in cold blood in US school shootings since 1999.

“Worth it” - Charlie Kirk.

""Federal Court finds criticising Israel, the IDF, and Zionism over the genocide in Gaza, is NOT antisemitic.

Sensational findings by judge:
1. ""Political criticism of Israel, however inflammatory or adversarial, is not by its nature criticism of Jews in general or based on Jewish racial or ethnic identity.""
2. ""Disparagement of Zionism constitutes disparagement of a philosophy or ideology and not a race or ethnic group.""

More:
'The Federal Court found passages in an interview and sermon by Mr Haddad contained critical and disparaging things about the actions of the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza and about Zionists.

'However, the judge found the ""ordinary, reasonable listener"" would not understand those things to be about Jewish people in general.

""That person would understand that not all Jews are Zionists and that disparagement of Zionism constitutes disparagement of a philosophy or ideology and not a race or ethnic group,"" Justice Stewart said.
