How unjust is it not be able to go to shariah courts for your affairs, but instead to the courts of the tawaghit who are only in favor of their own desires, who don't fear Allah in their judgement, who are the enemies of Islam"""

""This individual behaves like a prostitute in the way he unsolicitedly praises the most filthy of Tawagheet. No amount of Fiqh and Usul al-Fiqh will save such an individual on That Day, when we’ve been commanded to do Al-Kufr Bi-Taghut, yet you’re out there selling your 5-star praise of the Tawagheet to the highest bidder.

If you say he’s not bought, then that’s even worse for him, for the one who sells his Deen for a small price still receives something of this Dunya, whereas the one who sells his Akhirah for free is worthless in the Dunya and Akhirah.

Never lend an ear to a mouthpiece of the Tawagheet, no matter how knowledgeable he may seem, for if he’s betrayed his Lord in applying sacred knowledge, why wouldn’t he betray you in the way he conveys it to you?

Seek Ilm from those who are blessed with Knowledge, call to it, act upon it without comprise, and who suffer at the hands of the Tawagheet because of it.

If someone doesn’t have the first 3, pay absolutely no attention to what they say. If they have all 4, grab hold of them and cherish them, defend them against slander, and support them even if only in your nightly Duā, for they are indeed the inheritors of the Salaf."""

Both making circus clown Ta’wil that contradict the understanding of the Salaf, as recorded by the Imam of the Mufassireen. Both like to larp as if they’re sophisticated and deep, but in reality they’re just flirting with atheism on the regular. May Allah destroy them, and make an example of them and their likes على رءوسِ الأشهاد."""
