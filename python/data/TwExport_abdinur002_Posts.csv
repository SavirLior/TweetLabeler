"2010123126391415267","The real question to Iranians may be: is it the religion that oppresses, or is it the way a particular interpretation is imposed and enforced by those in power? 

There’s no doubt that Persia had its own rich civilization and deep intellectual traditions long before the arrival of Islam to the empire.

However, we should note that Persians were also among the peoples involved in the army that took over the Sasanian Empire. It wasn’t a purely “Arab” army. There were in Arabs, Persians, Ethiopians, and others in that army. 

Then, Persians embraced Islam and contributed enormously - through scholarship, governance, literature, and the sciences to the growth and enrichment of the Islamic world. For 1400 years, no Iranian/Persian blamed the religion. 

Moreover, Iranians did not view Islam itself as the problem prior to Khomeini’s rise. If you ask secular Iranians who lived during the Shah’s reign (or earlier), many will tell you their issue was not with the faith as a personal religion, they had no problem with it. So what changed?

By contrast, you rarely hear citizens of countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia - where they generally follow the teachings of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, say they want to flee because of Islam itself. 

That comparison is something worth reflecting on.","en","Retweet","Salah al-Iranee","SalahIranee","6308","4","22","1","67","25","2026-01-11 00:54:34","https://x.com/SalahIranee/status/2010123126391415267","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-VkBYWXcAEjhlg.jpg"

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said:

Among people are those who backbite to go along with his sitting companions, his friends and his relatives, while knowing that the one being backbitten is innocent of what they are saying, or that only some of what they say is true.

Yet he thinks that if he were to object to them he would spoil the atmosphere of the gathering and that the people present would find him burdensome (i.e. they would not want him there).

So he considers agreeing with them to be from good social conduct and pleasant companionship! And they may become angry, so he becomes angry due their anger, and so he engages in it along with them.
