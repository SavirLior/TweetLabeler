""🚨 What the UAE and its media platforms are engaged in is organised Zionist propaganda, alongside a crude and aggressive promotion of what is labelled the “Abrahamic religion”, under the patronage of Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ, one of the chief devils of Arabia). 

In this discourse, the so-called “good Muslim” is redefined as the slaughtered, silent Muslim: one who accepts Jewish and European racial supremacy and learns to coexist with genocide by treating it as a political inevitability and a series of “unfortunate events”.

Those presented as “activists” have never ONCE addressed Jewish Talmudic religious ideology or colonial Zionist political ideology, both of which legitimise mass killing and strip the Other of their humanity and which were invoked by the highest Israeli authorities.

❌ They did not speak about Netanyahu’s speech, in which he invoked the myth of the “Amalekites” and biblical texts to justify genocide in Gaza.
❌ They did not speak about Gallant, who described the population of Gaza as animals and denied the existence of any civilians.
❌ They did not speak about an Israeli minister who openly called for the nuclear bombing of Gaza and the extermination of its population.
❌ They did not speak about the flag marches in Jerusalem, nor about settlers’ chants insulting the Prophet Muhammad and calling for the killing of Arabs and the burning of their villages.
🩸 They did not speak about Israel killing 80,000 Palestinian Muslim people.
🩸 They did not speak about Israel killing 6,000 Lebanese Muslims.
🩸 They did not speak about Israel killing 1,200 Iranian Muslims.
🩸 They did not speak about Israel killing 1,000 Yemeni Muslims.
🩸 They did not speak about Israel killing Muslims in Iraq and Syria.
🩸 They did not speak about the UAE’s support for mercenary militias and its partnership in the extermination of the people of Sudan.

All of this silence, only for them to suddenly transform into moral authorities and preachers of “humanity”, simply because this time the killing involved Muslims and the victims were Israeli and Australian Jews.

⚖️ They spoke only of an alleged “Islamic ideology” that killed 12 Israelis, while entirely ignoring expansionist Jewish Talmudic ideology, articulated openly by its rabbis and its prime minister, which has resulted in the killing of more than 100,000 Arabs and Muslims, a genocide documented in sound and image, and the occupation of Arab land in Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria.
❗ This is a stripping away of the most basic meaning of humanity.
❗ This is moral selectivity fully aligned with a colonial and supremacist worldview.
❗ This is political complicity and direct service to the occupation’s narrative.

The UAE will sooner or later face divine punishment just like every other evil entity."""

The West and Britain in particular, has spent decades lecturing Muslims about “terrorism,” cultivating the false notion that Muslims pose some unique threat to global stability. Yet here we are again: their allies and ideological offspring brazenly gunning down innocent children, mirroring the very brutality of the Zionist entity they so loyally protect.

What is even more disgraceful is the deafening silence of Britain’s palace-approved imams. They posture with moral authority, yet lack the backbone to call out the heinous crimes committed by the British state and its partners. Instead, they sit poised with pen in hand, ready to condemn Mujāhidīn for resisting the same barbaric violence that these governments routinely unleash on Muslim populations.

And the greatest irony? These voices never exhibit even a fraction of the grief or urgency for Muslim blood that they display for others entirely outside their remit. Their selective outrage has become a trademark, a betrayal disguised as “moderation.”

The hypocrisy is staggering. The blood of Muslims, it seems, is still the cheapest currency in the Western moral economy."""

Like his companion, Imam Luqman Abdullah, who preceded him, these were men who, in shā’Allāh, remained steadfast and true to their covenant with Allāh. They stood in stark contrast to many other “imams” in the West, who faltered and compromised.

Though they may not have been formally recognized as ulama, they—in shā’Allāh—acted upon the knowledge they possessed, which is what truly matters. نَحْسُبُهُمْ كَذَلِك، وَاللَّهُ حَسِيبُهُمْ، وَلَا نُزَكِّي عَلَى اللَّهِ أَحَدًا.
