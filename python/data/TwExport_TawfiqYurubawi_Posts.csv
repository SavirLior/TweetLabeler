"2010123126391415267","The real question to Iranians may be: is it the religion that oppresses, or is it the way a particular interpretation is imposed and enforced by those in power? 

There’s no doubt that Persia had its own rich civilization and deep intellectual traditions long before the arrival of Islam to the empire.

However, we should note that Persians were also among the peoples involved in the army that took over the Sasanian Empire. It wasn’t a purely “Arab” army. There were in Arabs, Persians, Ethiopians, and others in that army. 

Then, Persians embraced Islam and contributed enormously - through scholarship, governance, literature, and the sciences to the growth and enrichment of the Islamic world. For 1400 years, no Iranian/Persian blamed the religion. 

Moreover, Iranians did not view Islam itself as the problem prior to Khomeini’s rise. If you ask secular Iranians who lived during the Shah’s reign (or earlier), many will tell you their issue was not with the faith as a personal religion, they had no problem with it. So what changed?

By contrast, you rarely hear citizens of countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia - where they generally follow the teachings of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, say they want to flee because of Islam itself. 

That comparison is something worth reflecting on.","en","Retweet","Salah al-Iranee","SalahIranee","6308","4","22","1","67","25","2026-01-11 00:54:34","https://x.com/SalahIranee/status/2010123126391415267","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-VkBYWXcAEjhlg.jpg"

Lesson Four

A glimpse into the life of the Third Khaleef- 'Uthmān ibn 'Affān (may Allāh be pleased with him).

By Shaykh 'Abdulilah Lahmami @Abdulilah_UK (may Allāh protect him).*

• His nickname- the possessor of two lights.
• He made the first migration to Abyssinia and also the second migration to Madeenah.
• He had 16 children, 9 boys and 7 daughters. 
• He possessed tremendous shyness and even the angels were shy in his presence. 
• He was very generous. 
• Islām spread far and wide during the reign of 'Uthmān. 
• The tears of 'Uthmān at the graveyard. 
• 'Uthmān's martyrdom was testified by the prophet (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him).
• The oppression of the khawarij against 'Uthmān  
• The people of Sunnah love all the companions and it is not allowed to speak ill of any one of them, we only mention them with good.","en","Retweet","Markaz Mu’aadh","MarkazMuaadh","3422","0","13","0","20","6","2025-12-31 19:17:10","https://x.com/MarkazMuaadh/status/2006414340904087603","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>","","https://soundcloud.com/markazmuaadh/lesson-four-a-glimpse-into-the-lives-of-the-four-rightly-guided-khulafa-a-glimpse-into-the-life-of-the-third-khaleef-uthman-ibn-affan-may-allah-be-pleased-with-him","",""
