1,"Seems like the younger brother of Mullah Dadullah (called Akhtar Mansoor Dadullah) was not like Mullah Dadullah.

Mullah Umar hated Mansoor Dadullah and kicked him out of Waziristan for spilling blood in 2007/2008.

OBL also warned against Mansoor Dadullah being oppressive."
2,"Any Talib spilling innocent blood in Waziristan is not one of us and may he be condemned to Hell for kidnapping family members of police officers for money.

This was with Mansoor Dadullah and some IMU militants."
3,"🪵Some untold histories of Jihadi politics Part 5:

Mansoor Dadullah. 
He was the younger brother of Mullah Dadullah. He was not happy with the leadership changes in IEA and eventually turned against IEA and that led him to his doom.

But some misconceptions need to be cleared."
4,"Another deviant Taliban was called Muhammad Rasul who also rejected Mullah Hibatullah. But in 2021 he surrendered and admitted he was wrong.

He gave bayah to IEA in 2021 again and his faction rejoined IEA.

He is still alive today but no longer military active."
5,"I don't know what Mansoor Dadullah did in Waziristan but Mullah Umar really hated him for some reason.

7,"Sayyid Qutb was the opposite of Mustafa Kemal

Mustafa Kemal abolished Shariah, seperated religion from governance and made women rights to rule.

Sayyid Qutb completely reversed his work and made his theology that the only acceptable Islam is political Islam with shariah."
8,"Sayyid Qutb's project was a mixture of Rashidun Caliphate, Ibn Taymiyya works, Jihadi conquests, historic Islamic fitnah civil wars and Muhammad ibn abdul Wahhab work.

His version of Islam was mainly political Islam opposed to tyrants and Shariah can truly free societies."
9,"Sayyid Qutb interpetation that political Islam can truly free societies has been adopted by some groups nowadays.

When you lookup ideology of AQ, ISIS and others then you find Qutbism in it.

Sayyid Qutb directly influenced people like Abdullah Azzam &amp; OBL"

""#AlQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has just released a startling 7-pager explaining why #Trump’s rule represents a historic opportunity for #jihad. Here’s a synopsis of what the jihadis are predicting & planning for:
▪️World is “sliding towards a third world war” which will change the map
▪️US soft power has gone; it’s now about brute force
▪️East-West conflict will weaken both
▪️#China, #Russia, #Iran, #Turkey & others who oppose the West cannot ally with al-Qaeda but will seek to benefit from its efforts. States “We will not enter into conflict with them at this stage unless they initiate it”. Fascinatingly, it adds: “Some of them may even provide support, but sparingly, cautiously, & deliberately, allowing us to survive”. But it warns jihad groups not to trust or rely on them.
▪️“Make America Great Again” will ultimately result in the collapse of #NATO, Europe & the entire West
▪️Predicts that “the foolish pirate Trump” will remain in power by cancelling elections or changing the constitution
▪️Trump’s “thuggish, colonial approach” & obsession with power will generate internal conflict that will further weaken the US
▪️Blames #Maduro’s failure on religious bankruptcy
▪️Societies (incl in Arab countries) will be divided by economic crises, growing inequality, consumerism (at the expense of development), loss of trust in leaders, disillusionment with institutions
▪️Jihad stands ready to harness growing global anger at “Zionist-Crusader arrogance”""
