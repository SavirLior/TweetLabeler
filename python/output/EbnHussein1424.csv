I think Daniel Haqiqatjou might be suffering from a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, he keeps getting rinsed with the facts but insists on coming back for another round with the sandal 🩴.

In any case, this thread is a comprehensive history of the Wahhābī assault on Karbalāʾ in 1802.

[1] The Ottoman violation of the treaty between them and the First Saudi State
[2] The Shīʾī attack on a group of civilian Wahhābī caravans
[3] The Ottomans’ refusal to punish the perpetrators
[4] The Saudi advance towards Karbalāʾ
[5] The Wahhābīs did not attack civilians
[6] Karbalāʾ had become a refuge for worst elements in society
[7] The Wahhābī assault only lasted for a few hours"""

Another grotesque and utterly foolish heresy of the Twelver Shia Rafidah, one that even relatively informed Sunnis are often oblivious to when dealing with this pagan Majoosi cult, is the following: they do not merely hold annual aza (mourning) for their so called infallible imams, despite aza in Islam being limited to three days, nor do they merely engage in excessive jahili coordinated self flagellation rituals. Rather, on top of that, they stage annual idolatrous funeral reenactments for their mini-god imams and even for the Prophet, peace upon him, himself.

They theatrically produce coffins, a practice copied outright from Christianity, carry them in processions, and parade them around shrines in tawaf-like rituals. 

The scenes shown in the video are from Al-Kazimiyyah in Baghdad.

By Allah, this is not Islam. 

It is necromantic theatre, ritualised corpse worship, and open shirk dressed up in black cloth and false piety. 

These people are not merely innovators. 

They are zanadiqah mushrikun, reviving pre Islamic paganism under the fraudulent banner of love for the Ahl al Bayt, peace upon them, who by Allah will declare their bar’ah from them on Judgement Day if they do not repent and stop attaching these Iranian Safawi heresies, which theatricalised mourning, to the Prophetic household."

""During my long journalistic career I have encountered the anti-Iran Iranian diaspora in the UK on many occasions and I can confidently say that they are among the most vile, batshit crazy, lying, deluded people I have ever met in my life.

I've seen these people spit on others they politically disagree with, use violence, and scream and shout incoherent nonsense. They are extremists who think they are right and everyone else is wrong, even though they are a minority among actual Iranians.

They are mainly atheists or Muslims in name only, and have contempt or no regard for religion. Unlike real Iranians in Iran.

They are alcohol drinkers who love the West and Western culture in every way. This is their natural home, not Iran.

I'm sure many of them work for MI5 or Mossad and loads of them got here in the first place by pretending to be gay or apostates.

They have been lobbying for Western military intervention in Iran for years and would love to ride into Tehran on the back of American or Israeli tanks.

In Iran they are considered traitors. And, of course, these are the people who are now telling porky pies about mass murder in Iran to goad Donald Trump into bombing their homeland.

I will caveat this by saying I also know many kind, good God-fearing Iranians in the UK who I exempt from the above. Real Iranians, I mean.""

""Unlike real Iranians in Iran""

Roshan is from the Subcontinent with zero understanding of mainstream Iranian culture, something anyone who has actually visited Iran can tell you. The fact is that most Iranians LOATHE the Khomeinist regime, and a large number despise what they think is Islam--namely Rafidism and even like Israel. This is not just my claim; even professors inside Iran say this openly:"

35,"Ah, the cyber Basiji and agent of Khamenei should tell us why anyone should believe Khamenei’s taqiyyah fatwa, when he himself, at times, forgets to uphold it and instead reverts to the very foundation of his religion: takfir of the Sahabah. He even invites Shia eulogy singers to his Hosseiniyeh-temple who are known to curse the Sahabah.

And if any mental gymnastics are produced to excuse this, then a simple question remains for that cyber Basiji: when did Khamenei ever condemn Khomeini or ban his books, in which Khomeini--Khamenei’s own teacher and the founding father of the modern-day Shii Iranian state--explicitly stated that Aishah, the wife of the Prophet ﷺ, was more impure than dogs and pigs? This shirk defender, Haqiqatjou, under the pretext of unity, is sanitising Rafidism, which is exactly what the Rafidi regime of Iran has been doing; he is simply following their playbook."
36,"Khomeini, who is not only Khamenei’s foremost teacher but also the founder of the modern day Shia state of Iran, explicitly referred to the honour of the Prophet, peace be upon him, that is his  wife Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her,  as more filthy than pigs and dogs, and said other evil things about the Sahabah. Yet in his taqiyyah speeches he called for unity, just as Khamenei does. Why? In order to fool gullible Sunnis and penetrate their lands for Khomeinist Safawi expansionism. 

Daniel Haqiqatjou knows these nuances yet still sanitises Rafidism anyway. Do not fall for the taqiyyah."
