What is truly ironic is that these people never even mentioned him in previous years, nor did they pay him any attention. Today, however, they present him as the muhaddith of Egypt, despite his major and well-known errors. This only exposes their extremes and instability.

Their principle is clear: “If you are with us, then you are righteous and elevated; if not, then you are debased.”

"2011748369857687645","A Clarification to End the Confusion Surrounding False Claims of Tazkiyah & Taḥd͟hīr for Al-Biyalī

S͟hayk͟h Aḥmad Bāduk͟hn @ahmedbadokhon2 (may Allāh preserve him) writes:

This statement which some people distort: “read it as it was circulated in image form” does not mean that transmitting information is only accepted through audio or writing. Rather, it explains the customary practice of the S͟hayk͟hs in exercising caution when issuing Tazkiyah. However, the one who intends to cause agitation will cling even to seaweed!

And if some of our brothers, may Allāh guide them, did not refrain from believing lies, or from failing to verify what they transmit, and from exploiting that for agitation, as I clarified in the previous audio, then it is no surprise that they would deliberately distort the statement and interpret it, whether with good intent or bad intent.

What is astonishing is that not long ago they were transmitting from these very S͟hayk͟hs (S͟hayk͟h ʿArafāt and S͟hayk͟h ʿAbbās) that they were praising His͟hām Al-Biyalī, and they even wrote refutations based on that—let alone the insinuations and disparagement directed at the virtuous S͟hayk͟hs. Then after that, they transmitted from S͟hayk͟h ʿArafāt that he does not praise Al-Biyalī, and that whoever attributes such praise to him is a liar!

In reality, they know that S͟hayk͟h ʿArafāt does not hold the view that Al-Biyalī should be declared an innovator, nor does he see him as a Ḥaddādī or a Quṭbī. However, no tazkiyah has been issued for him. Brother S͟hihāb Al-Bannā informed me of this and said: “S͟hayk͟h ʿArafāt discussed with me his view of not declaring Al-Biyalī an innovator”, and he said: “nevertheless, no Tazkiyah has issued from me for him.” So S͟hihāb began transmitting some of the S͟hayk͟h's words while concealing other parts of them.

For this reason, I said: it is the practice of the S͟hayk͟hs to be keen on documenting and verifying Tazkiyah, especially when there is disagreement and confusion.

"2010418717595693223","“ولا تصح الصلاة خلف من صلاته فاسدة إلا من لم يعلم حدث  نفسه ولم يعلمه المأموم حتى سلم فإنه يعيد وحده”
ابن قدامة عمدة الفقه

“Prayer is not valid behind one whose own prayer is invalid, except in the case where he himself did not know of his state of impurity, and the follower also did not know of it until after the imam had completed the prayer. In that case, the imam alone repeats the prayer.” Ibn Qudamah – ʿUmdat al-Fiqh

قال الشيخ اللحيدان   "" إذا صلى إمام بالناس وهو على غير طهارة فالذين يعلمون انه على غير طهارة صلاتهم غير صحيحة والذين لم يعلموا الا بعد انتهائه منها صلاتهم صحيحة ولكن صلاته هو غير صحيحة لأن عمر بن الخطاب صلى بالناس الفجر وكان جنبا من الاحتلام ولم يكن يعلم وفي الضحى رأى أثر الاحتلام فما كان منه إلا أن اغتسل وأعاد صلاة الفجر ولم يأمر الناس بأن يعيدوا ""

Al-Shaykh Al-Luhaydan explains:
If the imam leads the people in prayer and he is not in a state of purity, then those who know he is not in a state of purity, their prayer is invalid , and those who did not know until the imam had completed the prayer, then their prayer (meaning the followers) is correct. However, the imam himself, his prayer is invalid. That is because ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb led the people in the Fajr prayer while he was in a state of impurity due to a wet dream, which he was not aware of. By the early forenoon, he noticed the traces of the wet dream, so he took a bath and repeated the Fajr prayer, but he never commanded the people to repeat the prayer.

This is explained by Al-Shaykh Al-Luhaydan in ʿUmdat al-Fiqh, page 293

A question to zubair tower hamlets Somali @DawahTH 

It has come to our attention that a document circulating in WhatsApp groups contains doubts and attacks against the Mashāyikh of Aden and Shaykh Arafāt. Alongside this, a commentary/translation is also being circulated, which people are saying was translated by Zubair from Tower Hamlets (Somali).

We therefore ask you clearly and directly, Zubair:
Are you responsible for translating and spreading this commentary? If so, then state this openly.

It should be noted that the original document itself carries no name or attribution, a well-known deceptive tactic (أسلوب الماكرة) used by those who wish to spread harm while keeping their hands clean.

What is truly strange is that there are people who are busy circulating the alleged “mistakes” of scholars from another country, yet remain oblivious to the established mistakes of  @AbuIyaadSP Abu Iyaad. So from justice and consistency, they should also be willing to highlight and circulate the actual established mistakes of a caller from their own country.
So we ask 

What is your position regarding Abu Iyāḍ’s recent attack (in a now deleted article with no clarification or tawbah as of yet picture attached above  ) on Shaykh al-‘Allāmah Bukhārī, in which he discredits him and claims that Shaykh Bukhārī has not demonstrated competence or coherence in dealing with fitan and nawāzil, especially in light of recent events? 

If you truly claim Salafiyyah, where is your defence of this great scholar?
Are you pleased with this clear revilement of a scholar and with blocking the people from returning to one of the bonafide scholars of our time? Is the  flesh of the scholars not poisonous 

We demand a clear and urgent response.
