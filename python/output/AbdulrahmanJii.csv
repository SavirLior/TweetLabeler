A beloved brother of mine is being tried by Allaah with cancer. He is someone well known to our teachers and brothers alike, known for his salafiyyah, his call and defense of it, and likewise known for raising fonations and funds for families in need. He is shy to seek/consistently ask for help, so I am doing it for him إن شاء الله.

Please make dua for our brother, especially in those times mentioned in the Sunnah, and donate whatever you are able to help this father/brother/husband/son.

The goal is to at least raise £3000 for further treatment, but raising more would be better إن شاء الله
