"2001310485191270884","We are required to stop our brothers when they transgress. Remember the hadeeth which means: ""Aid your brother, whether he oppresses or is oppressed.""

Think carefully about your betrayal when you are too weak or shy to show real love & concern by telling your brother, ""No, let's not take this course of action. Let's rethink this. Let's consult our scholars, etc."" 

Consider that your weakness & failure to uphold real brotherhood contributes to his corruption. You empower a transgressor & enable him. When you fail to step in, your shyness or weakness is truly harmful, and all people involved suffer.

If it is someone involved in da'wah, it harms the da'wah & the people who carry it. It harms the transgressor & his victims. Look how transgressions snowball, from minor violations of the rights of students of knowledge, eventually into open attacks on the scholars.

People who love this da'wah: Man up, seek Allah's Assistance, & speak with the noble words which Allah commands His believing worshippers to say:

يا أيها الذين آمنوا اتقوا الله وقولوا قولا سديدا
""O you who believe! Have taqwaa of Allah & speak with words of truth, firmly grounded & to the point...""

May Allah bless the tongue & pen of every sincere advisor & the heart of every erroneous person being advised. May Allah save us from transgression & terrible trials & may He grant us firmness & steadfastness upon what He loves.","en","Retweet","Moosaa Richardson أبو العباس موسى الطويل","1MMeducation","18618","7","122","1","275","58","2025-12-17 17:16:16","https://x.com/1MMeducation/status/2001310485191270884","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","","","",""
