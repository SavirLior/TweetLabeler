Important Lessons For Every Muslim

By Imām 'Abdul 'Azeez bin Bāz (may Allāh have mercy upon him)

Read by Ustādh Abū 'Ināyah Seif (may Allāh protect him)

A highly beneficial series of 17 lessons covering 'Aqeedah (belief), Tawḥeed, matters related to acts of worship, and Islamic etiquette and manners.

These lessons are simple, beneficial, and enjoyable. We highly recommend them for new Muslims, those newly practising Islām, and for families to study together with their children on a weekly basis.

This will help provide both parents and children with a sound foundational understanding of their religion and, in-shā-Allāh serve as the beginning of a journey towards studying Islām in greater depth.

May Allāh reward our beloved teacher Abu 'Ināyah tremendously and make his efforts heavy upon his scales of good deeds."""
