"2012008126736720358","Isa ibn Maryam (ﷺ) was only a Prophet and nowhere in the Gospel did he claim to be God.

Allah informed us of a conversation that will occur between Him and Isa.

مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَآ أَمَرْتَنِى بِهِۦٓ أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبَّكُمْ ۚ

""I (Isa) said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allāh, my Lord and your Lord."" - (Al-Ma'idah - 117)

In the Bible, Isa was reported to have said the same:

""The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength"" - (Mark 12:29-30)

Isa in Quran said he is a Servant of Allah:

قَالَ إِنِّى عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ ءَاتَىٰنِىَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيًّۭا

""[Jesus] said, ""Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet."" - (Surah Maryam 30)

In the Bible, Isa was reported to have said the same:

""By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me."" - (John 5:30)

It is only from the traditions of the currupt Christians that he is labeled anything more then a Messenger of Allah.

As this is all he said about himself:

""Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."" - (Luke 13:33)

Isa ibn Maryam (ﷺ) is free from those who exaggerated his status.

And they will be the losers who will reside in the hellfire for eternity.

I ask Allah to guide the Christians to the truth, and unite us upon what all the Messengers were upon.

""Say, ""O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allāh and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allāh.""1 But if they turn away, then say, ""Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]."" - (Ali 'Imran 64)

---------------------------------------------------------

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: 

""The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts).""

"2011712762179616783","""When God alone is not the ultimate goal of the servant’s desire and the end of his purpose, and He is the beloved and desired one for him by nature and the first purpose, and everything else is only loved, desired, and sought after for His sake, then he has not fulfilled the testimony that there is no god but God, and he has in him a deficiency, a defect, and polytheism to the extent of that, and he has the causes of that in terms of pain, regret, and torment according to what he missed of that.""

Ibn Al-Qayyim said:

""Whoever knows God Almighty, His names and attributes best, desires Him most, loves Him most, and is closest to Him. He found in his heart a sweetness that cannot be expressed, and can only be known through taste and longing.

 When the heart tastes that, it cannot give precedence to love for anyone else, or his relatives. And the more his love for Him increases, the more his servitude, humility, submission, and bondage to Him increases, and he is free from the bondage of others.

The heart cannot prosper, be rectified, find joy, delight, pleasure, tranquility, or peace except through the worship and love of its Lord and turning to Him in repentance. 

Even if it were to possess all the pleasures of creation, it would not find contentment or peace in them; rather, they would only increase its need and anxiety until it attains what it was created and prepared for: that God alone be the ultimate goal and the fulfillment of its desires. 

For within it lies an inherent need for its Lord and God, insofar as He is its object of worship, its beloved, its God, and its ultimate goal, just as within it lies an inherent need for Him insofar as He is its Lord, its Creator, its Provider, and its Sustainer. And whenever the love of God takes root in the heart and strengthens therein, it expels from it any worship or servitude to anything other than Him.

He became free, honorable, and dignified. His face shone with light and radiance.

There is no believer who does not have in his heart love for God Almighty, tranquility in remembering Him, delight in knowing Him, pleasure and joy in remembering Him, longing to meet Him, and comfort in being near Him, even if he does not feel it, because his heart is preoccupied with something else, and he is distracted by what he is preoccupied with. The existence of something is not the same as feeling and being aware of it.

Its strength, weakness, increase, and decrease: are according to the strength, weakness, increase, and decrease of faith.

When God alone is not the ultimate goal of the servant’s desire and the end of his purpose, and He is the beloved and desired one for him by nature and the first purpose, and everything else is only loved, desired, and sought after for His sake, then he has not fulfilled the testimony that there is no god but God, and he has in him a deficiency, a defect, and polytheism to the extent of that, and he has the causes of that in terms of pain, regret, and torment according to what he missed of that.

Even if one were to strive for this desired goal by every means and try every avenue, without seeking God's help, relying on Him, and acknowledging one's dependence on Him for its attainment, and without being certain that it can only be achieved through His grace, will, and assistance—for there is no other way whatsoever—he would not achieve his goal. For whatever God wills comes to pass, and whatever He does not will does not come to pass. Therefore, none but He can lead to it, none but He can guide to it, none but He can be worshipped except through His assistance, and none but He can be obeyed except by His will.""

"2011312526227611999","Despairing and not trusting in Allah is the root of these peoples problems.

They have lost all hope, so much so, that they now have adopted an approach of removing Israel by any means.

Even if those means are Kuffar, who will rule in contrary to the Shariah.

Any Muslim who hopes for the Taghut to take power, in any case, is a disbeliever.

Shaykh Sulaymān ibn Sahmān said it well:

""So whoever believes that implementing the Islamic Sharia leads to fighting and discord, and that unity and harmony can only be achieved under the rule of the ṭāghūt, is a kaafir, an enemy of Allah and all the messengers. 

For this is exactly the belief of the disbelievers of Quraysh, who thought the truth lay in what their forefathers followed, rather than what Allah sent His Messenger with.”

Second point:

If you know that referring to the ṭāghūt for judgment is Kufr, then know that Allah has stated in His Book that disbelief is worse than killing:

“And fitnah is worse than killing.” (Al-Baqarah 2:217)

and “Fitnah is worse than killing.” (Al-Baqarah 2:191).

The term fitnah here means Kufr. So even if the desert dwellers and the townsfolk were to fight one another until they perished, it would still be lighter than establishing a ṭāghūt on earth who rules contrary to the Sharia of Islam which Allah sent His Messenger with.

Third point:
If this kind of judgment is Kufr, and disputes are only over worldly matters, then how could you justify committing kufr for the sake of this world? A person does not truly believe until Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than everything else, and until the Messenger is dearer to him than his child, his parent, and all people.

So even if you were to lose all your worldly possessions, it would never be permissible to seek judgment from the ṭāghūt for their sake. And even if someone forced you, giving you a choice between appealing to the ṭāghūt or giving up your worldly goods, you would be obliged to sacrifice them, and it would not be permissible for you to resort to the ṭāghūt.”
(Ad Durar as Saniyyah 10/509 511)

I do not understand why these people feel the need to chose a side.

And why they assume the Iranian rule would be any better for the Muslims.

Before Israel, Iran was our biggest enemies in the middle east. Even still they push their kufr and shirk on society.

So what ""better evil"" do you speak off?

Shirk is Shirk, Kufr is Kufr.

Anyone who commits them is equal and should be removed.

They also play this false narrative that not supporting the Taghut of Iran means you support Israel.

I seek refuge in Allah.

I ask Allah to destroy both, and establish the Muslims so that we may have our rights, and justice may prevail.

I question the Islam of anyone who thinks the Taghut may be better for us.

Only ruiling by Allah is better for us.

There is no ""better evil"" there is only good vs evil.

And one must be on the side of good and striving against evil with whatever you can.

May Allah guide us and grant us success.

You should teach the Muslims what is correct, not trap them into saying what isnt.

You do not guide the ignorant by telling them to speak about what they may be ignorant in.

You guide them by calling to the truth.

Its also not correct to say things like,

""Maybe you are (A Kafir)""

This is something i heard Jake Brancatella say.

If a Muslim shows us belief outwardly, it is not for us to question his state, so long as he does not do anything to nulify it.

If a Muslim shows disbelief, hes labeled a disbeliever.

If he shows belief, hes labeled a believer.

We do not look further then whats apparent,

People should remember that this life is nothing but worship.

Everything you do should be done seeking to be with Allah in the highest ranks.

You have been obligated to spread what is true, not change the hearts of the people.

So spread what is true, and leave what does not benefit you.

""How many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides)."" - (Sahih Muslim 1064)

""And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."" - (Adh-Dhariyat - 56)

""And they were not commanded except to worship Allāh, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakāh. And that is the correct religion."" - (Al-Bayyinah - 5)

""But if they turn away - then We have not sent you, [O Muḥammad], over them as a guardian; upon you is only [the duty of] notification/conveyance."" - (Ash-Shuraa - 48)

""And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned."" - (Al-Isra - 36)

Ibn Taymiyyah said:

""If someone utters a word of disbelief with his tongue without need, deliberately and knowingly, that it is a word of disbelief, then he disbelieves by that outwardly and inwardly. 

It is not permissible to say that inwardly he may be a believer. Whoever says that has departed from Islam.

 God Almighty said: {Whoever disbelieves in God after having believed, except for one who is forced [to renounce his faith] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who willingly open their breasts to disbelief - upon them is wrath from God, and for them is a great punishment . }

It is known that the term ""disbelief"" here does not refer to mere belief in the heart, because a person cannot be forced into that. The verse excludes those who are coerced. 

It does not refer to those who merely utter words and believe, because the verse excludes those who are coerced, who are not forced to make a covenant or utter a statement, but only to utter it. 

Thus, it is understood that the verse refers to anyone who utters a word of disbelief, incurring God's wrath and a severe punishment, and who is considered a disbeliever for that, except for those who are coerced while remaining steadfast in their faith. 

However, anyone who willingly embraces disbelief while coerced is also a disbeliever. Therefore, everyone who utters disbelief is a disbeliever, except for those who are coerced and utter words of disbelief while remaining steadfast in their faith. 

God Almighty said regarding the mockers: {Make no excuses; you have disbelieved after your belief.} He clarified that they are disbelievers by their words, even though they did not believe in their truth. 

This is a broad topic, and its understanding is based on what has been previously mentioned: that belief in the heart prevents the intention to speak or perform an act of contempt and disdain, just as it necessitates love and veneration. 

The presence or absence of this in the heart is a matter established by God's way with His creation, just as the perception of what is pleasurable necessitates the perception of the opposite of pain, so if the effect is absent, it necessitates the absence of the cause, and if the opposite is found, it necessitates the absence of the other opposite. 

So speech and action that include belittling and contempt necessitate the absence of beneficial belief and the absence of submission and surrender, and therefore it is disbelief.

Know that faith, even if it is said to be belief, means that the heart believes in the truth, the words are believed in the heart, and actions confirm the words.""
(as-Sarim al-Maslul ala Shatim ar-Rasul pg. 524)

Ibn Taymiyyah said:

""Likewise, whoever calls upon other than God and makes pilgrimage to other than God is also a polytheist, and what he did is disbelief, but he may not know that this is forbidden polytheism.

Many people from the Tatars and others entered Islam while they had small idols made of felt and other materials, and they would approach and venerate them without knowing that this was forbidden [in the religion of Islam, and they would also approach the fire without knowing that this was forbidden] . 

Many types of polytheism may be hidden from some who entered Islam and they do not know that it is polytheism. This person is misguided and his act of polytheism is invalid, but he does not deserve punishment until the proof is established against him.""

Abdullah ibn ‘Utbah reported: Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said, 

“Verily, people were judged by revelation in the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and the revelation has ceased. We only judge now what is manifested outwardly of your deeds. Whoever shows us good, we will trust him and bring him close. It is not for us to judge anything of his inner secrets. Allah will hold him accountable for his inner secrets. Whoever shows us evil, we will never trust him or believe him even if it is said his intentions are good.”
(Sahih al-Bukhari 2641)

""Then He established Himself upon the Throne"" [Al-A'raf: 54]: 

""The Throne is upon the water, and God is above the Throne""

Lets see who else he takfeered.

Ibn Battah (997 CE) said:

They make Takfeer of Ibn Battah and the Ijma who held this view.

Imam Malik (795 CE) said: 

""God is in heaven and His knowledge is everywhere.”

""The Jahmites wanted to deny that God spoke to Moses and that He is on the Throne. They were asked to repent, and if they repented, well and good; otherwise, their necks were struck.""

(Abū Dāwūd, Masāʾil Abī Dāwūd, p. 262.)

They Takfeer Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi.

Ali ibn al-Madini (849 CE) was asked what the people of the Sunnah and the community say, and he said: 

""They believe in the vision and the speech, and that God Almighty is above the heavens, established on His throne.""

(Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Ḥamawiyyah, p. 53)

They Takfeer Ali ibn al-Madini and the people of his time.

Qutaybah bin Saeed (854 CE) said: 

""This is what the imams in Islam say: We know our Lord is in the seventh heaven on His throne.""

(Ibn Taymiyyah, Talbīs al-Jahmiyyah, 2/38)

They Takfeer Qutaybah bin Saeed and the Imams of his time.

Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (855 CE) was asked: 

Is God above the seventh heaven on His throne, separate from His creation, and is His power and knowledge everywhere? 

He replied: ""Yes, He is on His throne and His knowledge is not absent from any place."" 

He was asked, may Allah have mercy on him, about someone who says: Allah Almighty is not on the Throne.

He said: “All their talk revolves around disbelief.”

(Al-Sunna by al-Lalika'i, 3/445/ Ijtima' al-Juyush, on his authority, p. 200)

They Takfeer Imam Ahmad.

Abu Zur’ah (878 CE) and Abu Hatim al-Razi (890 CE) said: 

""The people of Islam are united in affirming the attributes of God Almighty, and that He is on His throne, separate from His creation, and God’s knowledge is in every place. Whoever says otherwise, may God’s curse be upon him.""

(Al-Sunna by al-Lalika'i, 1/198)

“Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, ‘We believe in some but reject others,’ and wish to adopt a way in between.” - (An Nisa 150)

""And do not eat of that upon which the name of Allāh has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. And indeed do the devils inspire their allies [among men] to dispute with you. And if you were to obey them, indeed, you would be associators [of others with Him]."" - (Al-An'am 121)

""And it has already come down to you in the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] that when you hear the verses of Allāh [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them."" - (An-Nisa 140)

""Let not believers take disbelievers as allies [i.e., supporters or protectors] rather than believers. And whoever [of you] does that has nothing [i.e., no association] with Allāh"" - (Ali 'Imran 28)

""And whoever does not judge by what Allāh has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers."" - (Al Ma'idah 44)

Two were Jewish women taken through war, one was a Christian Egyptian woman reportedly handed to him as property (gift), and one was nine years old.

27 raids. 56 smaller military incursions.

"2006640031302115456","Putting his hand on the Quran, declaring that he will serve America, and rule by it by other then what Allah revealed.

This is one of the biggest insults a polytheist can do.

Not only is he a Polytheist, but he is also a Polytheist who swears by Allah hes a Polytheist.

The ""Muslims"" who claim this man is a Muslim is indirectly claiming a person can declare they are a Polytheist who takes Allah's law as secondary to Americas.

I fear for the state of whoever calls this man a Muslim.

You have not even grasped the Shahadah let alone be a Muslim until you reject exactly what this creature is.

Reflect on what you will be questioned about on the Day of Judgement.

I believe understanding that everything you do will be questioned would prevent people from doing the acts they do.

It bothers me how people will be quick to hide their sins (out of embarrassment) to the public, but even more quick to do the sin while Allah is their witness and judge.

Eternal Hellfire awaits the person who nulifies their Islam.

"2006207095662628890","I see alot of American Soilders make posts like these.

But what i never understand is when exactly did they feel remorse?

Was it when you killed innocent men, women and children?

Was it when either you or your comrades pillaged neighbourhoods, striking the people with famine?

Or was it when you left the innocent with permanent scars that they will never recover from?

The truth of the matter is that they only felt remorse when they realised their country betrayed them.

Which means they feel THEY were wronged,

Not that THEY wronged the people.

It is this selfishness which helps you understand the people you are dealing with.

If their country was upon what they thought they were upon when they left.

They would feel pride in the killing, scaring, oppressing of innocents.

This is why the Muslims are the best example of people as Allah stated.

""You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allāh. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient."" - (Ali 'Imran 110)

We enjoin good and forbid evil, no matter if its against ourselves or against others.

Where as these disbelievers enjoin whatever benefits them personally.

They are socially accept psychopathic serial killers.

"2005803022534779356","A 7th Century Christian Monk’s Account of Life Under Islamic Rule.

""Justice flourished under his reign, and a great peace was established in the countries that were under his government, and allowed everyone to live as they wished.""

John bar Penkaye wrote:

""When they had settled the business according to their methods, the victory fell to the Westerners called Ummayyads, and this after a great slaughter that took place between them. A man among them named Muawiya, took the reins of government of the two empires: Persian and Roman. 

Justice flourished under his reign, and a great peace was established in the countries that were under his government, and allowed everyone to live as they wished. 

They had received, as I said, from the man who was their guide, an order in favour of the Christians and the monks. 

Similarly because of his guidance they held to the worship of one God, according to the customs of the old law. Firstly, they were so attached to the tradition of Muhammad who was their leader, that they inflicted the death penalty on anyone who seemed not to obey his commands. 

Their troops went every year into distant countries and islands, raided and brought back captives from all the nations that are under heaven. 

From every man they required only the tribute, and left him free to hold any belief, and there were even some Christians among them: some belonged to the heretics and others to us. 

While Muawiya reigned there was such a great peace in the world as was never heard of, according to our fathers and our fathers' fathers. It was as if our Lord had said: ""I will test you in this way, as it is written: 'by grace and justice iniquity may be pardoned.""
