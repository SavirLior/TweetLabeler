"1991137960863936531","Wallahi an unforgettable journey! From Kuwait to Makkah, it was truly beautiful! and that is the same sentiment anyone who attended has. The many sittings, whether with the people of knowledge or the students of knowledge or just the many brotherly sittings over good food or coffee, the whole occasion was monumental and hugely beneficial for the soul!

It brings to mind the statement of Imām Ibnil Qayyim:

“Keeping the company of the righteous transforms you from six states to six others:
1.From doubt to certainty.
2.From showing off (riyā’) to sincerity.
3.From heedlessness to remembrance (dhikr).
4.From desiring the worldly life to desiring the Hereafter.
5.From arrogance to humility.
6.From bad intention to genuine sincere naṣīḥah.”

"1947963261011267933","The West must dismantle the Muslim Brotherhood in full, not just monitor it, not just debate it. Dissolve it. Shut down its networks, charities, and political fronts.

Countries like Ireland, the UK, the US, France, and Germany must follow the example set by the UAE and Jordan. These aren’t just foreign policy moves, they’re acts of national defense.

Every day the Muslim Brotherhood is allowed to operate is a day it recruits, infiltrates, and rewrites the rules from within. This is not an organization with a place in civil society. It is a threat engineered to exploit it.

The UAE labeled the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and removed it from every institution, educational, religious, financial, and civic. Jordan went even further: the Brotherhood formally dissolved itself after losing all political and legal ground. These were not gestures. They were deliberate state decisions to eliminate the roots of radicalism before they could bloom into violence.

Ikhwanis: Parent/guardian can be present in a marriage sit-down, but they are requested not to interfere with the sessions.

So the guardian cannot ""interfere"", and as to add to the humiliation, he should pay a fee to ""observe"", whilst his daughter is in a ""rotational setting"" meeting other men. He is the walī, he should be jealous over his ward and not exhibit beta-male energy.

For the people who lazily proclaim: Why do you Salafis busy yourself with refutations?

This is why. We observe nonsense like this daily and out of love for Kitāb and Sunnah and love for the truth to be upheld, we speak out. This is the vigilance every Muslim should have in defending the Sunnah and uniting the people upon it.

Porting speed dating concepts into Islamic marriage meet-ups is humiliation and ignorance, adopting the methods of the disbelievers. It reminds us of the narration:

There is a brother who is a student of knowledge, actively engaged in Da’wah as part of SD (San Diego) Da’wah in the US.

I know the brother and his condition, he previously arranged for a Da’wah center and a bookshop to be established by taking out some loans. Unfortunately, last year, the brother was hospitalised with life threatening Tuberculosis which he has now recovered from. Due to his illness and there not being many Salafis around him, he was unable to cover the costs of rent for the premises during his illness and subsequently the center was closed down. The Da’wah efforts remain largely online as can be seen from the Twitter account for @SDdawah.

The brother remains in $3500 (~£2800) of debt which the debtors are demanding be paid back immediately.

I'm trying to aid his situation, he is due to return to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to complete his studies however is unable to do so at the moment due to this debt looming above his head.

There is a brother whom I know personally who is struggling immensely with his financial situation.

Due to health related circumstances beyond his control, he has been been unable to provide for his family resulting in insurmountable debt which has severely affected his mental health.

He has since returned to work but only on a part-time basis despite him having the drive and willingness to do more, at times he barely has enough money to pay for groceries and basic amenities for his family and children. This has resulted in further anguish and grief.

I am looking to raise £5000 for him, to clear his debts and to enable him some respite to get back onto his feet, but most importantly to alleviate his hardship and instil hope that the future is bright - InshaaAllah.
